dhcpc 1.0 -:- A DHCP client for Syllable

dhcpc is a simple DHCP/BOOTP client for Syllable 0.4.3 and later.  dhcpc is
released under the GNU General Public Licencse.  See the file COPYING for more
information.  dhcpc is Â©2002 - 2003 Kristian Van Der Vliet
(vanders@users.sourceforge.net)

dhcpc is included with all versions of Syllable starting with 0.4.3  The
source code for the latest version of dhcpc can be retrieved from the Syllable
CVS servers.  See the Syllable website at http://syllable.sourceforge.net
for more information.

Usage

dhcpc can configure your IP address, subnet mask, gateway address and DNS
server entries from a DHCP server.  dhcpc can be started either as a
normal process, or as a background deamon process.

Normally, you should use the Network Preferences application to enable or
disable DHCP for a network interface.  However, if you wish to start dhcpc
manually, then please read the following.

To start dhcpc as a deamon, on the Ethernet interface 'eth1':

$ dhcpc -d eth1

To start dhcpc as a normal process, simply omit the '-d' flag.

Depending on the compilation options used, dhcpc may produce a lot of
debugging output.  You can choose to redirect the output to a logfile
(E.g. /var/log/dhcpc) with E.g.

$ dhcpc -d eth1 2>>/var/log/dhcpc

or to /dev/null with

$ dhcpc -d eth1 2>>/dev/null

If the DHCP server responds with a list of available DNS servers,
then dhcpc will overwrite /etc/resolv.conf with the DNS server entries.

dhcpc will automatically add a gateway route entry if a gateway address
is supplied by the DHCP server.

TODO

o Currently the client always releases the IP address when it catches
   SIGTERM.  It would be preferable if we stored the lease details and sent
   a renewal request when the client was started next.

o The client can not always deal with packets arriving out of sequence.

o It would be nice if the user could supply various details at startup,
   E.g. requested IP, lease time etc.

o There are probably some bugs!
