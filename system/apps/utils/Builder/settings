;	For some strange reason, Linux defines OSTYPE and MACHTYPE, but doesn't pass them to child processes.
;	If you have the misfortune of running it, define them here:
	OSTYPE		linux-gnu
	MACHTYPE	i586-pc-linux-gnu

	CFLAGS		-march=i586 -O2 -pipe
	CXXFLAGS	-march=i586 -O2 -pipe

; For cross-compilation:
;target			i586-pc-syllable
