        <p>
        Thank you for installing Syllable, one of the most exciting Open Source Operating Systems today!  Syllable has been in constant development for many years, and offers a compact, fast, well designed and easy to use Operating System.  Unlike many other Open Source Operating Systems Syllable has only one goal: to be the best Open Source Operating System on your desktop computer.
        <p>
        The software and files that are distributed with Syllable are released with different Copyrights and Licenses.  <a href="file:/atheos/Documentation/Copyrights.html">The Copyrights document</a> provides more information.
        <p>
        Syllable already offers internet and multimedia capabilities and if you're interesting in developing software for Syllable there is a unique and exciting design waiting for you.
        <p>
        Whatever you want to do, this short document is here to help you with your new Syllable installation and offers some pointers to further information.
        <p>
        <font face="Arial" size=4><b><u>Software</u></b></font>
        <p>
        Syllable is designed as a modern desktop Operating System, and has a unique design which makes managing software easy.
        <p>
        We separate software for Syllable into two categories.  Software which has been written for Syllable, using methods unique to Syllable, is known as "native" software.  Syllable is also capable of running software which has been designed for more traditional UNIX style Operating Systems such as Linux, which is known as "non-native" software.
        <p>
        Because non-native software can not take advantage of the advanced features Syllable offers, installing such software differs from the way in which you install native Syllable software.  Instructions on how to install both native and non-native software for Syllable are described below.  You should choose the correct method depending on the type of software you are installing.
        <p>
        <font face="Arial" size=3><b><u>Installing native software</u></b></font>
        <p>
        Applications which have been written for Syllable can be installed anywhere you wish, although the usual location is in the /Applications directory.  Most applications come as a single archive, which can be unpacked wherever you wish to install the software.  Syllable uses the ZIP archive format.  For example, if we wanted to install the ABrowse web browser:
        <p>
        <table width="99%" cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#ffffff" border=1 bordercolor="#cccccc">
          <tr>
            <td valign="top">
              <tt>unzip abrowse-0.4.0a.bin.zip -d /Applications</tt>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
        Uninstalling native software is equally simple.  Just delete the application directory:
        <p>
        <table width="99%" cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#ffffff" border=1 bordercolor="#cccccc">
          <tr>
            <td valign="top">
              <tt>rm -r /Applications/ABrowse</tt>
            </td>
          </tr>
         </table>
         <p>
         <font face="Arial" size=3><b><u>Installing non-native software</u></b></font>
         <p>
         Unix or POSIX style applications usually come as a single archive which contains all of the files the application needs in one self contained distribution.  Syllable now favours the ZIP archive format, but older software may still be distributed in GZiped TAR files.
        <p>
         To install a package you simply open an ATerm, log in as the root user if you are not already, and unpack the archive with a command such as:
         <p>
         <table width="99%" cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#ffffff" border=1 bordercolor="#cccccc">
           <tr>
             <td valign="top">
               <tt>unzip gcc-4.1.1.bin.1.zip -d /usr</tt>
             </td>
           </tr>
         </table>
         <p>
         Then you must run the Syllable package manager tool to register the package with the system. For example, to install GCC, run:
         <p>
         <table width="99%" cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#ffffff" border=1 bordercolor="#cccccc">
           <tr>
             <td valign="top">
               <tt>pkgmanager -a /usr/gcc</tt>
             </td>
           </tr>
         </table>
         <p>
         This will create a series of symbolic links in various subdirectories of /usr/indexes/ to make it possible for the system to find executables and other files belonging to the package.
         <p>
         If you want to uninstall the package you must run the package manager again to allow Syllable to properly and cleanly update itself.  For example, to uninstall GCC:
         <p>
         <table width="99%" cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#ffffff" border=1 bordercolor="#cccccc">
           <tr>
             <td valign="top">
               <tt>pkgmanager -r /usr/gcc</tt>
             </td>
           </tr>
         </table>
         <p>
         You can then delete the actual package directory itself:
         <p>
         <table width="99%" cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#ffffff" border=1 bordercolor="#cccccc">
           <tr>
             <td valign="top">
               <tt>rm -r /usr/gcc</tt>
             </td>
           </tr>
         </table>
         <p>
         Please note that this way of installing software should ONLY BE USED FOR COMMAND LINE APPLICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PORTED TO SYLLABLE FROM UNIX AND OTHER OS's USING A UNIX LIKE FILESYSTEM. Native applications should use the various mechanisms available in Syllable for making the application "position independent" so it can be installed anywhere.  See the section "Installing native software" for more information.

         <font face="Arial" size=4><b><u>Developing for Syllable</u></b></font>
         <p>
         Syllable is still under heavy development, and there is plenty of opportunity for anybody who is interesting in developing software for Syllable or working on Syllable itself.
         <p>
         Syllable is a POSIX compliant Operating System, with large parts of POSIX 1, 2 and 4 available.  Above the POSIX layer Syllable has a unique set of C++ API's which provide utility classes, a Graphical User Interface, high level I/O and networking components which can all take advantage of the advanced design of Syllable.
         <p>
         The development toolchain is based on the usual GNU tools such as BinUtils, GCC 4 and Make.  Several editors and IDE's are available for Syllable, which can be found on Syllable software websites such as Kamidake.
         <p>
         Many POSIX, UNIX and Linux command-line applications can be easily ported to Syllable, but Syllable does not use X11 nor any X toolkits.  Porting graphical applications from other platforms requires a native Syllable GUI to be written.
         <p>
         The majority of the Syllable kernel and POSIX systems are licensed under the GNU General Public Licence.  The Syllable C++ libraries are licenced under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
         <p>
         If you're interested in developing with Syllable you should join the Syllable-Developer mailing list.  The source code for Syllable is available via. anonymous CVS at :pserver:anonymous@syllable.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/syllable  You can also browse the CVS repository at <a href="http://syllable.cvs.sourceforge.net/syllable/syllable/">http://syllable.cvs.sourceforge.net/syllable/syllable/</a>
