1 Introduction
==============

This documentation applies to version 0.6.x of the build system for
the Syllable operating system. If you encounter problems or have any
other interesting observations, I would be interested to hear about
them (see contact information).

2 How to install the build system on Syllable
=============================================

2.1 
----

Please note that the build system is written in the Ruby language,
hence you need to have the Ruby interpreter installed. Refer to the
Ruby package for Syllable for instructions on installing Ruby.

Now for the installation of the build system. If you received this
software in a Zip package, you should have unpacked this file with

    unzip Builder-0.6.66.bin.1.zip

or something equivalent. This package contains an anonymous CVS
checkout, so you can update it over the Internet. This will ensure
that you have the latest version, with the latest package definitions.
It is also possoble to get the build system from the Syllable CVS
repository manually. The location of the build system in Syllable CVS is

    /syllable/system/apps/utils/Builder

The software is contained in the subdirectory Builder. This can be
installed anywhere. In Syllable, it is usually installed under /usr/.
If you unpacked or copied it somewhere else, do:

    mv Builder /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/Builder

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find the build
system's files.

You can also use Builder on Linux (and possibly on other POSIX-like
systems, but this has not been tested yet). An easy way to do so is
to install it in your home directory and add the Builder/bin directory
to your $PATH environment variable. This way you don't need super-user
access.

You should now be able to use the build system.

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading the build system
---------------------------------------------

If you ever want to remove the build system, follow these steps. For
example, you should do this before you install a new version of the
build system. Again, you may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to the build system from Syllable.
You should even do this when you want to upgrade the build system,
because the links may have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/Builder

To delete the files belonging to the build system, run:

    rm -r /usr/Builder

Keeping the build system up to date is easy if you have an Internet
connection. Just do

    build update
    build log

This requires that you have the CVS program installed. If you have
made your own modifications to files in the build system, you should
always check the log for conflicts and resolve them if there are any.

3 Getting started with the build system
=======================================

3.1 Command line syntax
-----------------------

The build system is called with one command: build. To see all
possible uses of this command, run

    build --help

The various options to the build command provide a toolbox for
building several kinds of software packages. Some of the options will
be used more often than others. Some of them are usually not
specified directly, but used internally by the build system.

3.2 Modes of operation
----------------------

The build system can work in several different modes of operation. It
can build a single software module or multiple modules at the same
time, and it differentiates between building the Syllable system and
building external applications. Which mode is used is determined by
how and where the build command is called.

A single module is built by passing the path to where the module
resides to the build command. Multiple modules are built by passing
the name of a profile, which is a list of software modules. If there
is a name conflict between a single module and a profile, you have to
make sure to include a slash in the directory name of the module to
distinguish it. You can do this by making sure there is a slash at the
end:

    build example/

or by including the current directory in the path:

    build ./example

When the build command is called from a working directory named
"system", it assumes it is building the Syllable base system. This is
the root directory of the Syllable directory tree in its CVS
repository. In this mode, several functions are performed
differently, so if you are building a separate application, make sure
it is not from a directory named "system".

3.3 Logging
-----------

Not all variations of the build command perform actual build
operations, but those that do are logged in several forms. During
building, only progress information and error messages are sent to
the screen, in order to provide a better overview of the process
(that is, stderr is sent to the screen as normal, but stdout is not).
The rest of the output (stdout) is captured in a log file. To see the
log of the last build operation performed, do

    build log | less

(It's usually quite long, so you will probably want to view it in a
pager such as "less".) If you are building multiple modules, you may
want to have a summary of the results, without all the process output:

    build log summary

When building multiple modules, the build system doesn't stop at a
module that won't build successfully. To see a list of only those
modules that didn't build, do:

    build log failures

3.4 Building a single native application
----------------------------------------

The simplest case of building a software module, as far as the build
system is concerned, is that of a native Syllable application. The
source code of the application should be self-contained, and should
conform to the specifications that the build system expects from a
native application. In this situation, the build system doesn't add
much value to building the module "by hand" by calling "make"
commands directly, so you may prefer that method. However, it forms
the basis for more useful operations.

You should place the source code in a subdirectory that will
typically have the same name as the application. Suppose the root
directory of the application is called "example". The first step in
building it would then be

    build example

Or if you placed the application directory in a subdirectory, for
example "applications":

    build applications/example

Watch the output to see exactly what operations are performed by the
build system. It will clean the source code, configure it, and then
try to compile it. If you want to see the standard process output as
well, do

    build log | less

If the build procedure was successful, you can optionally run a suite
of tests, if the application has one:

    build test example

If all is well, you can install the application. You may have to
become the super user to do that:

    su

Then run

    build install example

3.5 Building a third-party package
----------------------------------

3.5.1 About build recipes
-------------------------

Building a third-party software package, i.e. software that is not
native to Syllable but was ported to it from other systems, is much
like building a native module. Here, the build system is starting to
become useful. It shields you from many differences between the build
procedures of third-party packages. In order to do that, it needs
descriptions of these differences, that are written in the form of
something called a recipe.

The build system contains a number of recipes for packages that have
been ported to Syllable, so if you are building one of these
predefined packages, you don't have to worry about recipes. If you
are trying to build a package that is not known by the build system,
it is still possible that the default build procedure is able to
build it. The default procedure is oriented towards commonly used
build steps, and in particular towards the customary build procedures
of packages from the GNU project (http://www.gnu.org). If the default
procedure does not succeed in building a package, you will have to
find a recipe for it, or write one yourself. A common case would be
trying to build a newer version of a package that was ported before.
In that situation, chances are that the recipe for the older version
will work. In any case, refer to the chapter "Developing your own
packages".

3.5.2 Installing the source
---------------------------

3.5.2.1 
--------

You could install the source code for a third-party package manually,
in a similar way to how you would put the sources for a native module
into place. You would probably receive the official release of a
source package in the form of a compressed tarball, which you would
have to unpack in the place where you want to build it. However, the
build system can do this job for you. Just drop the source package
into the build system in the directory

    /usr/Builder/sources/

When you ask the build system to build a package for which the source
is not installed, it will look for it in this location and unpack it
automatically. This is most useful when you regularly have to remove
sources to clean up. As long as the source package is in the build
system, the sources will be restored when needed.

Even better, if the package has a build recipe that defines a download
location, and you have the WGet program installed, the build system
will download the source package and place it in /usr/Builder/sources
automatically.

3.5.2.2 Patching the source
---------------------------

In addition to the build recipe described earlier, the description of
a third-party package may also contain patches to the software that
are required for Syllable. These patches will automatically be
applied to the sources when you allow the build system to unpack the
official source package. If you install the sources yourself,
patching is also your own responsibility. However, you can still
explicitly tell the build system to apply any patches it has, like
this:

    build patch example

3.5.2.3 Sources from a CVS repository
-------------------------------------

Source code from a CVS repository is treated specially. If you build
a package that was checked out from a CVS repository, and the build
system has a tarball for that package, it will replace the CVS source
with the contents of that tarball. This is done because several
third-party packages won't build successfully after having made the
trip through CVS. Their internal build systems get confused by the
changing of time stamps on their files.

The build system recognizes a package from CVS by the presence of a
directory named "CVS" in each subdirectory. These directories no
longer exist after the source is replaced from a tarball. If no
tarball is available, the build system removes each of these CVS
directories, because some third-party packages detect them by
themselves and get confused by them.

Please take note that the removal of these CVS directories means that
your CVS repository will be broken! Therefore, you should never build
a third-party package that comes from CVS in your working copy of the
repository, but instead in a copy that you will not use for
subsequent CVS operations (like updating).

3.5.3 Building it
-----------------

As mentioned before, building a third-party software package is much
like building a native module. The name of the directory that
contains the source code will typically include the version number of
the package. The first step in building it would for example be

    build example-1.2

If you want to see the standard process output, do

    build log | less

If the application has a test suite, you can run it:

    build test example-1.2

To install the package, you may have to become the super user:

    su

The installion is done with

    build install example-1.2

Third-party packages will be installed into their own subdirectories
in the /usr directory. The Syllable package manager will be run to
register the package with Syllable.

The installation and registration can be undone with

    build uninstall example-1.2

If you want to distribute the package to others, you can build a
distribution package while the package is installed with

    build package example-1.2

The distribution package will be generated in your working directory.
Take care that you are not distributing any sensitive data that the
application may have written to its own directories while it was
running. If you want to be certain about this, you should build the
distribution package immediately after installing the program, before
running it.

3.6 Building a single system module
-----------------------------------

3.6.1 
------

For the purpose of this documentation, a system module is a Syllable
module that is built in the context of the source tree for the
Syllable base system. The build system assumes this context when it
is called from a working directory named "system". Consequently, the
path names that you use to designate the modules you want to build
must be relative to this "system" directory.

The build system will set up a number of environment variables that
native system modules typically use. It assumes that the source tree
contains the complete Syllable source code, in particular the system
headers. It will also create a new directory tree structure in which
the module can be installed. This directory tree ultimately serves to
create an image for a new Syllable distribution.

Although the build system will make a number of preparations for
building a system module, it is still your job to ensure the right
environment. System modules often rely on particular system headers
and libraries. Those tend to change when Syllable evolves, which can
break the build if different versions are not compatible. By default,
when compiling software in the "system" directory, headers from the
Syllable source tree are used. These things can be tricky, and there
is no easy recipe for them.

3.6.2 Installing the source
---------------------------

Typically, the sources for the Syllable tree and the module to build
would be installed from CVS. If the module is a third-party package,
the same considerations apply that were described in the section for
building a third-party package. The build system will unpack and
patch the sources if it can. You are free to modify the tree, as long
as you know what you are doing.

3.6.3 Building it
-----------------

The commands for building a system module are no different than those
for stand-alone applications:

    build example

Installing the module into the running system is done with

    build install example

However, modifying your installed system can be dangerous. Modules can
be built and installed in one go into a staging area.

    image example

will install the module in the staging area where a directory tree is
built for a Syllable distribution. The staging area is located in the
subdirectory "stage/image" within the "system" directory. From there,
you can inspect the results of the build and move files into your
running system selectively.

3.7 Building multiple modules
-----------------------------

3.7.1 
------

More than one module can be handled in one go by the operations of
the build system. This is done by passing a profile name to the build
command, instead of a module path. For example, to build a number of
modules, enter:

    build example-profile

The build system recognizes a profile name because it doesn't contain
a slash ('/'), as opposed to a module path. A profile simply contains
a list of modules. All the modules in the profile will be acted on
sequentially. The logs will contain all the actions on all modules,
even if one or more of the modules failed.

You can get a list of the modules in a profile by entering

    build modules example-profile

You can test all the modules in a profile in one go:

    build test example-profile

And you can install them all at once:

    build install example-profile

A profile can contain both native and third-party modules. The way
they are handled corresponds to what was described earlier in their
respective sections. Because of that, the

    build uninstall example-profile

command and the

    build package example-profile

command will have different effects, depending on what modules are in
the profile and whether you are building stand-alone applications or
part of the Syllable base system.

3.7.2 Writing a profile
-----------------------

Profiles are stored in the build system at this location:

    /usr/Builder/profiles/

A profile is simply a text file that you can write yourself. Each
line should contain a module path. Comment lines are allowed; they
should start with a semicolon (';') in the first position.

3.7.3 Predefined profiles
-------------------------

The build system contains some predefined profiles that can be
useful. Some profiles are generated automatically by the build
system itself. After a build operation, the profile named "failures"
will contain a list of the modules that failed. This is very handy if
you are building a long list of modules where some of them have
errors. You can use

    build log failures

to be shown the log of failing modules from your last operation.
After making fixes, using

    build failures

will rerun the build procedure on only those packages that weren't
built successfully yet. This will even work if you invoked the build
command on single modules inbetween while making fixes, because the
profile "failures" is only updated when working with a profile. The
procedure can be repeated until all modules are repaired.

Another auto-generated profile that you can use is named "last". This
profile always contains the last profile that the build command was
used with.

3.8 Building a compound package
-------------------------------

The build system is capable of producing distribution packages
consisting of multiple third-party packages. For example, the build
system contains a profile named "dev-pack", for the Developer Pack.
This is a collection of third-party packages commonly used by
developers. You can build all those packages with:

    build dev-pack

To install such a list of packages, you would normally do:

    build install dev-pack

(In this case, it's more complicated than that, because the Developer
Pack contains several packages that need themselves to build and
sometimes even to install themselves, like Make, Binutils and GCC.
You would have to replace these packages carefully and individually.)

When the packages are installed,

    build pack dev-pack

will create one distribution package in your working directory that
contains all the packages from the profile, and optionally extra
files like documentation.

3.9 Building the Syllable base system
-------------------------------------

At the time of writing, it is not possible to give a definitive
instruction for building the entire Syllable base system. Although
the build system basically is capable of doing this, this is a work
in progress that evolves with the development of Syllable. Furthermore,
if you try to build from CVS sources, you will most likely encounter
build failures that exist along the way to the next Syllable release.

That said, here is a basic description of how the system is built. For
starters, there is a huge number of prerequisites that you have to
fulfill before this makes any sense. Here is a - subject to change,
and probably incomplete - list of packages you need to install. Some
of them are available as binary packages, others you wil have to build
from source with the build system.

- The Syllable source code
- Developer's Delight
- PERL Pit
- WGet
- DiffUtils
- GAWK
- TexInfo

There are several profiles that define a list of all the modules of
the base system. The process goes like this:

    cd system

    image system
    build log failures

    image base
    build log failures

    image compatibility
    build log failures

    cd stage/image
    build scrub

Along the way you will have to fix build failures, using techniques
from this manual. Please have patience, and use at your own risk.

4 Developing your own packages
==============================

To port a third-party package to Syllable and integrate it with the
build system, you have to write a Builder recipe for it. Full
documentation for this needs to be written, but there is an up to date
specification for the syntax of recipes, in the file

    Builder/packages/skeleton.recipe

For examples of recipes, please study the existing ports in
Builder/packages/.

5 Known problems and limitations
================================

The Syllable build system is a work in progress. It will develop with
Syllable, so changes and improvements will be made regularly.
Therefore, it is best to use a recent version, or at least a version
that matches the software you are building.
