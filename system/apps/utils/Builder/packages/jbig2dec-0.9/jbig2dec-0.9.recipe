headline			JBIG2 image decoder
summary
	jbig2dec is a decoder implementation of the JBIG2 image compression format. JBIG2 is designed for lossy or lossless encoding of 'bilevel' (1-bit monochrome) images at moderately high resolution, and in particular scanned paper documents. In this domain it is very efficient, offering compression ratios on the order of 100:1.
