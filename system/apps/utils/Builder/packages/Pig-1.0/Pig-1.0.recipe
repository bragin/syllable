headline			Pig game
description
	Fixed Rate Pig was intended as an SDL programming example, to demonstrate the use of a fixed virtual logic frame rate together with interpolation, also known as "tweening". However, it turned into a (sort of) playable platform game, so it's more of a how-it-all-fits-together example. (No sound, though.)

	Apart from fixed rate game logic, this game also demonstrates sprite animation and partial/smart display updating techniques, suitable for games and applications that need high frame rates but can do without updating the whole screen every frame.
