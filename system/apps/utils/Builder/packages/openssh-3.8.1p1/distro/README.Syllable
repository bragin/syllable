OpenSSH for Syllable
====================

9-Jun-2004

1 Introduction
==============

This is a binary distribution of version 3.8.1p1 of the OpenSSH
remote access tool for the Syllable operating system. This
distribution was built on Syllable 0.5.3 with GCC 3.3.3, and was
optimized for a Pentium CPU. It should also run on other versions of
Syllable, but this has not been tested.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

See the file README for more information on OpenSSH.

2 How to install OpenSSH on Syllable
====================================

2.1 
----

2.1.1 
------

You may have to become the root user to perform the following
operations:

    su

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xpz

or something equivalent. The 'p' option to tar is important: it
preserves permissions on the extracted files. Without the proper file
permissions, the installation will be broken.

Unpacking produces the directory openssh. This should be installed
under /usr. If you unpacked it somewhere else, do:

    mv openssh /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/openssh

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find OpenSSH's files.
You should now be able to start OpenSSH; for example:

    ssh

2.1.2 Installing with the Syllable build system
-----------------------------------------------

If you have the Syllable build system installed, it can do the above
steps for you. Just do:

    su
    build install openssh-3.8.1p1.bin.1.tgz

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading OpenSSH
------------------------------------

2.2.1 
------

If you ever want to remove OpenSSH, follow these steps. For example,
you should do this before you install a new version of OpenSSH.
Again, you may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to OpenSSH from Syllable. You should
even do this when you want to upgrade OpenSSH, because the links will
most likely have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/openssh

To delete the files belonging to OpenSSH, run:

    rm -r /usr/openssh

2.2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading with the Syllable build system
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you install a package with the Syllable build system, it will
check if the package was already installed and remove the previous
version automatically.

If you just want to uninstall OpenSSH, do:

    su
    build uninstall openssh

3 Building OpenSSH on Syllable
==============================

Normally you don't have to, but if you want to compile OpenSSH
yourself, you need to get the source distribution. You can get the
OpenSSH distribution through its home page:

    http://www.openssh.org

Additionally, you need to have the OpenSSL library installed, which
is a separate package. The Syllable build system knows all other
specifics for building OpenSSH, so you should install that as well.
Please refer to the respective installation instructions for these
packages.

When you have the build system installed, you should first provide it
with the OpenSSH source package:

    cp openssh-3.8.1p1.tar.gz /usr/Builder/sources

To configure and compile OpenSSH, do

    build openssh-3.8.1p1

from your work directory. If that succeeds, you can optionally run
the testsuite:

    build test openssh-3.8.1p1

To install and register the package, become root first:

    su

then do:

    build install openssh-3.8.1p1

After the installation, you could even create a distribution package:

    build distro openssh-3.8.1p1

4 Known problems and limitations
================================

The OpenSSH server sshd is not fully supported on Syllable, yet.
Syllable user xsdg has reported that it works with key-based
authentication. However, it doesn't currently support password-based
authentication, so this should be disabled in the configuration file.
