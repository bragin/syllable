headline			Lisp reborn as a scripting language
description
	NewLISP is a scripting language for developing web applications and programs in general and in the domains of artificial intelligence (AI) and statistics.
	NewLISP is a LISP-like scripting language for doing things you typically do with scripting languages: programming for the internet, system administration, text processing, gluing other programs together, etc. newLISP is a scripting LISP for people who are fascinated by LISP's beauty and power of expression, but who need it stripped down to easy-to-learn essentials. newLISP is small on resources like disk space and memory but has a deep, practical API.
