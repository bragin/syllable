headline			A simple C library for working with KD-Trees
description
	KDTree is a simple, easy to use C library for working with kd-trees. Kd-trees are an extension of binary search trees to k-dimensional data. They facilitate very fast searching, and nearest-neighbor queries. This particular implementation is designed to be efficient and very easy to use. It is completely written in ANSI/ISO C, and thus completely cross-platform.
