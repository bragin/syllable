headline			High-quality MPEG audio decoder
description
	MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 extension to lower sampling frequencies, as well as the de facto MPEG 2.5 format. All three audio layers - Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III (i.e. MP3) - are fully implemented.
	MAD does not yet support MPEG-2 multichannel audio (although it should be backward compatible with such streams) nor does it currently support AAC.
