; Directives for build recipes

; Commented-out directives are not implemented yet.
; Good style is to use the order of directives here (basically in order of execution).


; Recipe information

authors				<Recipe and patches authors, in historical order>
maintainers			<Recipe maintainers, if not first author>
status				broken | unstable | deprecated | unmaintained | incomplete | developing | testing | contributed
warnings			<Important notes that are relayed to the user>
notes				<Internal notes>

inherits			<Modules this recipe inherits from>


; Module information

name				<Display name of the package, if different from the file name>
headline			<Brief description>
description			<Full description>
licenses			GPL GPL-2 GPL-3 GPL-3+ LGPL GFDL GPL+exception BSD MIT ISC Apache Artistic Python MPL QPL OSI other PD freeware commercial

home				syllable.org
; Automatic downloading requires cURL (included in Syllable):
locations			<Download locations>
;archives			<Repositories>
packages
	<Source package names, if different from the recipe name or the package is at a subpath relative to the download location.
	Common package extensions (.tgz, .tar.gz, .tbz2, .tar.bz2, .zip) should be left off.>
	[<Path>]<Package> [<Subdirectory to unpack into (for packages after the first that should be unpacked inside the first, or for a package that doesn't contain a master subdirectory)>]
files				<Source file names>


; Dependencies (partly implemented)

needs
	<Build-, install- and run-time dependencies>
	<Package> [[> | >= | < | <= | <>] <Version>]
	Assumed to be always available: SEd, GRep, ZLib
build-needs
	<Build-time dependencies>
	Assumed to be always available: GNU Make, BinUtils, GCC
;test-needs
;	<Test-time dependencies>
install-needs
	<Install-time dependencies>
;run-needs
;	<Run-time dependencies>
;recommends
;	<Optional dependencies>
;conflicts
;	<Not needed, and conflicts (as opposed to "needs <>")>


; Patching options
; Work in the source directory.

; For replacing config.guess & config.sub with Syllable-aware versions:
patch-config		[<Subdirectories>]
; For packages produced with ancient AutoConf versions:
patch-legacy-config
patch				<Extra patching commands>
; Makes a package that uses LibTool generate shared libraries.
; Requires LibTool, AutoMake and AutoConf.
make-shared


; Subdirectory relative to source to build in.
; "." to build in the source directory.
build-dir			<Directory>


; Configuring
; Works in the build directory.

; <configure>

; [<pre-configure>]
; [<configure-env>] <configure-cmd> ([<configure-prefix>] | [<configure-args>]) [<configure-vars>] [<configure-options>]

configure			<Configuration commands override>

pre-configure		<Commands preceding configuration>
; Extra environment variables for configure:
configure-env
	VAR 'value'
; Configure command (sequence), if non-standard or in a non-standard location:
configure-cmd		configure
; Non-standard prefix option (with optional trailing whitespace):
configure-prefix	"--prefix="
; Arguments overriding prefix:
configure-args		--prefix=/resources/foo
; Extra variables for configure:
configure-vars
	VAR value
; Extra configure options:
configure-options	--with-option


; Non-standard install prefix variable, for staging or when configure is not available:
install-prefix-var	prefix

; Makefile, if non-standard or in a non-standard location:
make-file			Makefile


; Building
; Works in the build directory.

; <make>

; [<pre-make>]
; [<make-env>] make [<install-prefix-var>=<Final installation path>] [<make-vars>] [<make-options>] <make-targets>
; [<post-make>]

make				<Build commands override>

pre-make			<Commands preceding make>
; Extra environment variables for make:
make-env
	VAR 'value'
; Extra variables for make:
make-vars
	VAR value
; Extra make options:
make-options		-option
; Non-standard make targets:
make-targets		all
post-make			<Commands following make>


; Testing
; Works in the build directory.

; make [<test-options>] <test-targets>

; Extra test options:
test-options		-k
; Non-standard test targets (default is check):
test-targets		test


; Installing
; Works in the build directory.

; Execute the installation steps with sudo:
super-install

; Don't delete any previous installation:
merge-install

install-tree		<Extra subdirectories to create>

; Installing:
; <install>
; [<install-env>] make [<install-prefix-var>=<(Stage) installation path>] [<install-vars>] <install-targets>

install				<Installation commands override>

; Install prefix variable for imaging, in addition to configure install prefix:
system-prefix-var	DESTDIR

; Extra environment variables for make install:
install-env
	VAR 'value'
; Extra variables for make install:
install-vars
	VAR value
; Non-standard install targets:
install-targets		install

post-install		<Commands after make install, in the build directory>

; Extra files to install from the source tree.
; If the destination is an absolute path it will be relative to the root
; of the system image.
install-files
	<Original> <Destination>

; General documentation to install:
documentation		[README COPYING ABOUT-NLS NEWS ChangeLog TODO AUTHORS THANKS]
; Documentation for building from source:
;build-docs			INSTALL
; Documentation for developers using the package:
develop-docs		[docs]
; Internal documentation for developers of the package itself:
;internal-docs		docs

; Remaining installation works in the installation directory.

; Links to create
; The destination link is relative to the package root unless it's an absolute path.
; The path of the original is free-form if it is absolute or is marked as relative
; by starting with one or two dots. Otherwise, it's relative to the path of the
; destination link in the case of a link that's internal to the package, and
; relative to the package root in the case of a link in the system.
links
	[<Original> <Link>]

; Don't strip binaries:
no-strip

pre-register		<Commands before registration, in the installation directory>

; Files to move within the installation.
; If the destination is an absolute path it will be relative to the root
; of the system image.
move-files
	<Source> <Destination>
delete-files		<Files to delete from the installation>
