Perl Pack for Syllable Desktop
==============================

12-Oct-2008

1 Introduction
==============

This distribution contains binary packages of the Perl programming
language and some packages that depend on it, for the Syllable operating
system. Most packages were built on Syllable 0.6.5 and optimised for a
Pentium CPU. They may also run on earlier versions of Syllable, but this
has not been tested.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

2 How to install the Perl Pack on Syllable
==========================================

2.1 
---

You may have to become the root user to perform the following operations:

    su -l

Unpacking this distribution should have produced a directory with the
contained packages, this README document, and an install script.
Being the root user, go into the directory and run the install script:

    cd PerlPit
    ./install.sh

The individual packages will be unpacked into /usr/. Subsequently, the
packages will be registered, creating links in Syllable to enable it
to find the packages' files. If any of the package directories
already existed under /usr/, they will be unregistered and deleted
first. Please note, though, that no version of any of the packages
should be previously registered with a different directory name under
/usr/, because that would lead to conflicting package registrations.

You should now be able to use the programs in the Perl pack.

2.2 Uninstalling and upgrading the Perl Pack
--------------------------------------------

2.2.1 
-----

After installation, the Perl pack is effectively no longer one
package, but the individual packages it contained. If you ever want
to remove one or more of those packages, you should execute the
following procedure for each package. Again, you may have to become
root first:

    su -l

Then you should remove the links to the package from Syllable.

    package unregister <package>

To delete the files belonging to the package, run:

    rm -r /usr/<package>

2.2.2 Uninstalling individual packages with the Syllable build system
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have the Syllable build system installed, you can use it to do
the previous steps for you. Also, if you install an individual package
with the Syllable build system, it will check if the package was already
installed and will remove the previous version automatically.

If you just want to uninstall an individual package, do:

    su -l
    build uninstall <package>

2.2.3 Upgrading the entire Perl Pack
------------------------------------

Upgrading to a new version of the Perl pack is easy, since the
install script will remove the existing packages and replace them
with the new ones.

3 Known problems and limitations
================================

Please refer to the respective README files and possibly other
documentation that are included in each separate package.
