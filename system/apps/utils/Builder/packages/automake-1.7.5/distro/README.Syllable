Automake for Syllable/AtheOS
============================

13 June 2003

1 Introduction
==============

This is a binary distribution of version 1.7.5 of the Automake
makefile creation tool for the Syllable operating system. This
distribution was built on Syllable 0.4.3. It should also run on other
versions of Syllable and on the AtheOS operating system, but this has
not been tested.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

See the file README for more information on Automake.

2 How to install Automake on Syllable
=====================================

2.1 
----

You may have to become the root user to perform the following
operations:

    su

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xpz

or something equivalent. The 'p' option to Tar is important: it
preserves permissions on the extracted files. Without the proper file
permissions, the installation will be broken.

Unpacking produces the directory automake. This should be installed
under /usr. If you unpacked it somewhere else, do:

    mv automake /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/automake

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find Automake's files.
You should now be able to use Automake.

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading Automake
-------------------------------------

If you ever want to remove Automake, follow these steps. For example,
you should do this before you install a new version of Automake.
Again, you may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to Automake from Syllable. You
should even do this when you want to upgrade Automake, because the
links will most likely have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/automake

To delete the files belonging to Automake, run:

    rm -r /usr/automake

3 Building Automake on Syllable
===============================

Normally you don't have to, but if you want to build Automake
yourself, you need to get the source distribution. You can get the
Automake distribution through its home page:

    http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/

See the file README for details.

Now you could use

    ./configure

but this will configure Make for installing Automake in /usr/local.
This is fine for local use, but to produce a distribution, I prefer

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/automake

to target it for /usr/automake.

Now you can do

    make

and optionally

    make check

After becoming root,

    make install

will install Automake's files. If you configured to install in
/usr/automake, you will have to let Syllable know:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/automake

If you had a previous installation in /usr/automake, it would be wise
to uninstall it before running make install:

    pkgmanager -r /usr/automake
    rm -r /usr/automake

4 Known problems
================

The Automake test suite (make check) generates an awful lot of
errors. I don't know if this should be reason for concern. :-/

You should be aware that compatibility problems exist between the 1.4
versions of Automake and the newer series (1.6x, 1.7x). So if you
need to run Automake, you may have to install the older version
1.4-p6 first.
