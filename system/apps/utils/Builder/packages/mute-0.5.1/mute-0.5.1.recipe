	MUTE has the worst build procedure and documentation ever.
	Build proces is interactive and blind in Builder! Choose GNU/Linux X86 text UI by entering:

	The libraries are built, but no executables.
	There is no documentation, so you'll have to look on http://mute-net.sf.net

description
	MUTE File Sharing is a peer-to-peer network that provides easy search-and-download functionality while also protecting your privacy.
