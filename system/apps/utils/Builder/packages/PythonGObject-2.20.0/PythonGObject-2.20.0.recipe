headline			Python bindings for the GObject library
description
	GObject is a object system library used by GTK+ and GStreamer.

	PyGObject provides a convenient wrapper for the GObject library for use in Python programs, and takes care of many of the boring details such as managing memory and type casting. When combined with PyGTK, PyORBit and gnome-python, it can be used to write full featured Gnome applications.

	This archive contains bindings for the GLib, GObject and GIO, to be used in Python. It is a fairly complete set of bindings, it's already rather useful, and is usable to write moderately complex programs. (See the examples directory for some examples of the simpler programs you could write).
