description
	xtrans is a library of code that is shared among various X packages to handle network protocol transport in a modular fashion, allowing a single place to add new transport types. It is used by the X server, libX11, libICE, the X font server, and related components.

	It is however, *NOT* a shared library, but code which each consumer includes and builds its own copy of with various #ifdef flags to make each copy slightly different.
