LibXSLT for Syllable/AtheOS
===========================

19 June 2003

1 Introduction
==============

This is a binary distribution of version 1.0.30 of the Libxslt XSLT
processor and library for the Syllable operating system. This
distribution was built on Syllable 0.4.3 with GCC 2.95.3, and was
optimized for a Pentium CPU. It should also run on other versions of
Syllable and on the AtheOS operating system, but this has not been
tested.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

See the file README for more information on Libxslt.

2 How to install Libxslt on Syllable
====================================

2.1 
----

Please note that Libxslt needs the Zlib library (as a subdependency
of Libxml). Zlib is not included in this distribution, so you have to
get that package and install it first, if it is not already installed
on your system. You need Zlib as a shared library. The Zlib packages
for Syllable are distributed in this form from version 1.1.4 onwards.

Now for the Libxslt installation. You may have to become the root
user to perform the following operations:

    su

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xpz

or something equivalent. The 'p' option to tar is important: it
preserves permissions on the extracted files. Without the proper file
permissions, the installation will be broken.

Unpacking produces the directory libxslt. This should be installed
under /usr. If you unpacked it somewhere else, do:

    mv libxslt /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/libxslt

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find Libxslt's files.

You should now be able to use the xsltproc XSLT processor and link
your programs with the Libxslt library.

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading Libxslt
------------------------------------

If you ever want to remove Libxslt, follow these steps. For example,
you should do this before you install a new version of Libxslt.
Again, you may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to Libxslt from Syllable. You should
even do this when you want to upgrade Libxslt, because the links will
most likely have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/libxslt

To delete the files belonging to Libxslt, run:

    rm -r /usr/libxslt

3 Building Libxslt on Syllable
==============================

Normally you don't have to, but if you want to build Libxslt
yourself, you need to get the source distribution. You can get the
Libxslt distribution through its home page:

    http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/

See the file README for details. Furthermore, you will need to have
the Libxml2 library installed.

Now you could use

    configure

but this will configure make for installing Libxslt in /usr/local.
This is fine for local use, but to produce a distribution, I prefer

    CFLAGS="-march=i586 -O2" \
        configure --prefix=/usr/libxslt

to target it for /usr/libxslt and optimize for a Pentium processor.

Now you can do

    make

and optionally

    make check

After becoming root,

    make install

will install Libxslt's files. If you configured to install in
/usr/libxslt, you will have to let Syllable know:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/libxslt

If you had a previous installation in /usr/libxslt, it would be wise
to uninstall it before running make install:

    pkgmanager -r /usr/libxslt
    rm -r /usr/libxslt

4 Known problems and limitations
================================

Libxslt cannot be compiled as a shared library on Syllable/AtheOS
because Libtool does not support this, yet.

5 Contact information
=====================

Libxslt was ported to AtheOS/Syllable by Kaj de Vos.
