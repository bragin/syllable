headline			Red[uced] REBOL programming language dialects
description
	Red is a new programming language strongly inspired by REBOL. It is open source and compiled. It will have a JIT compiler in addition to static compilation, modern parallel programming support through native threading, and a built-in web server. Red's goal is to be a general-purpose language with a broad usage field, from system programming to high-level scripting, parallel programming, network programming and embedding in applications.

	The current state provides a beta version of the lower level Red/System language, on which the alpha version of the higher level Red language is being built.
