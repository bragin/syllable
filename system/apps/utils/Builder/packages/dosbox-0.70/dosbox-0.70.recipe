description
	 DOSBox is a DOS-emulator that uses the SDL-library. DOSBox emulates an Intel x86 PC, complete with sound, graphics, mouse, modem, etc., necessary for running many old DOS games that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems. You can "re-live" the good old days with the help of DOSBox, it can run plenty of the old classics that don't run on your new computer!
