Flex for Syllable/AtheOS
========================

5 May 2003

1 Introduction
==============

This is a binary distribution of version 2.5.4a of the Flex lexical
analyser generator for the Syllable operating system. This
distribution was built on Syllable 0.4.3, and was optimized for a
Pentium CPU. It should also run on other versions of Syllable and on
the AtheOS operating system, but this has not been tested.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

See the file README for more information on Flex.

2 How to install Flex on Syllable
=================================

2.1 
----

You may have to become the root user to perform the following
operations:

    su

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xpz

or something equivalent. The 'p' option to Tar is important: it
preserves permissions on the extracted files. Without the proper file
permissions, the installation will be broken.

Unpacking produces the directory flex. This should be installed under
/usr. If you unpacked it somewhere else, do:

    mv flex /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/flex

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find Flex's files. You
should now be able to use Flex.

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading Flex
---------------------------------

If you ever want to remove Flex, follow these steps. For example, you
should do this before you install a new version of Flex. Again, you
may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to Flex from Syllable. You should
even do this when you want to upgrade Flex, because the links will
most likely have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/flex

To delete the files belonging to Flex, run:

    rm -r /usr/flex

3 Building Flex on Syllable
===========================

Normally you don't have to, but if you want to build Flex yourself,
you need to get the source distribution. You can get the Flex
distribution through its home page:

    http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/

Now you could use

    ./configure

but this will configure Make for installing Flex in /usr/local. This
is fine for local use, but to produce a distribution, I prefer

    CFLAGS="-march=i586 -O2" \
        ./configure --prefix=/usr/flex

to target it for /usr/flex and optimize for a Pentium processor.

Now you can do

    make

and optionally

    make check

After becoming root,

    make install

will install Flex's files. If you configured to install in /usr/flex,
you will have to let Syllable know:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/flex

If you had a previous installation in /usr/flex, it would be wise to
uninstall it before running make install:

    pkgmanager -r /usr/flex
    rm -r /usr/flex
