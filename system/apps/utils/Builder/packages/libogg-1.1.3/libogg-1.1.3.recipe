headline			Ogg multimedia container format library
description
	Ogg is a multimedia container format, and the native file and stream format for the Xiph.org multimedia codecs. As with all Xiph.org technology it is an open format free for anyone to use.
	As with most container formats it encapsulates raw compressed data and allows the interleaving of audio and video data inside a single convenient format. Other examples of container formats are Quicktime .mov, the MPEG program stream, and AVI.
	Ogg is a stream oriented container, meaning it can be written and read in one pass, making it a natural fit for internet streaming and use in processing pipelines. This stream orientation is the major design difference over other file-based container formats.
