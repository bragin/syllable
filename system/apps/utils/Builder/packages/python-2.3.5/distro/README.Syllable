Python for Syllable
===================

8-Jul-2004

1 Introduction
==============

This is a binary distribution of version 2.3.5 of the Python
programming language for the Syllable operating system. This
distribution was built on Syllable 0.5.6 with GCC 3.4.3, and was
optimized for a Pentium CPU. It should also run on other versions of
Syllable, but this has not been tested.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

See the file README for more information on Python.

2 How to install Python on Syllable
===================================

2.1 
----

2.1.1 
------

You may have to become the root user to perform the following
operations:

    su

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xpz

or something equivalent. The 'p' option to tar is important: it
preserves permissions on the extracted files. Without the proper file
permissions, the installation will be broken.

Unpacking produces the directory python. This should be installed
under /usr. If you unpacked it somewhere else, do:

    mv python /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/python

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find Python's files.
You should now be able to use Python; for example:

    python -h

2.1.2 Installing with the Syllable build system
-----------------------------------------------

If you have the Syllable build system installed, it can do the above
steps for you. Just do:

    su
    build install python-2.3.5.bin.1.tgz

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading Python
-----------------------------------

2.2.1 
------

If you ever want to remove Python, follow these steps. For example,
you should do this before you install a new version of Python. Again,
you may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to Python from Syllable. You should
even do this when you want to upgrade Python, because the links will
most likely have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/python

To delete the files belonging to Python, run:

    rm -r /usr/python

2.2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading with the Syllable build system
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you install a package with the Syllable build system, it will
check if the package was already installed and remove the previous
version automatically.

If you just want to uninstall Python, do:

    su
    build uninstall python

2.3 Getting started with Python
-------------------------------

/usr/python/Demo contains a number of sample Python programs. Note
that some scripts you may come across won't run as is, because they
contain a hardcoded path to the Python executable in the first line
of the script. This is unfortunate, as this location varies among
installations (Syllable likes to put it in /usr/python/bin). You can
change the first line of the scripts, or you can run them like this:

    python sample.py

When writing your own scripts, you could keep them portable by
finding Python dynamically in the first line:

    #!/usr/bin/env python

Have fun!

3 Compiling Python on Syllable
==============================

Normally you don't have to, but if you want to compile Python
yourself, you need to get the source distribution. You can get the
Python distribution through its home page:

    http://www.python.org

See the file README for details.

Additionally, you need patches to the source that are specific to
Syllable. These patches are kept in the Syllable build system. The
build system also knows all other specifics for building Python.

When you have the build system installed, you should first provide it
with the Python source package:

    cp python-2.3.5.tar.bz2 /usr/Builder/sources

You may alternatively use a GZipped package, if you have that.

To configure and compile Python, do

    build python-2.3.5

from your work directory. If that succeeds, you can optionally run
the testsuite:

    build test python-2.3.5

To install and register the package, become root first:

    su

then do:

    build install python-2.3.5

After the installation, you could even create a distribution package:

    build distro python-2.3.5

4 Known problems and limitations
================================

Obviously, features that are not implemented in Syllable (yet) will
not work from Python.

5 Contact information
=====================

Most of the porting work on Python was done by Octavian Cerna on
AtheOS. He implemented support for AtheOS native threads and shared
libraries, among other things. Jamie Clarkson adapted part of this
work to Syllable and to a newer version of Python. This version of
Python was built and packed for Syllable by Kaj de Vos. You can send
me problem reports, fixes and the like at

    python@syllable.info
