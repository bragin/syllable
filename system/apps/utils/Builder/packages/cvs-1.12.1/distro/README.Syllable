CVS for Syllable/AtheOS
=======================

13 June 2003

1 Introduction
==============

This is a binary distribution of version 1.12.1 of the CVS version
control system for the Syllable operating system. This distribution
was built on Syllable 0.4.3 with GCC 2.95.3, and was optimized for a
Pentium CPU. It should also run on other versions of Syllable and on
the AtheOS operating system, but this has not been tested. The remote
shell protocol defaults to Ssh. (Meaning: you don't have to set the
CVS_RSH environment variable to 'ssh'.)

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

See the file README for more information on CVS.

2 How to install CVS on Syllable
================================

2.1 
----

Please note that CVS needs the Zlib library. Zlib is not included in
this distribution, so you have to get that package and install it
first, if it is not already installed on your system. You need Zlib
as a shared library. The Zlib packages for Syllable are distributed
in this form from version 1.1.4 onwards.

Now for the CVS installation. You may have to become the root user to
perform the following operations:

    su

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xpz

or something equivalent. The 'p' option to tar is important: it
preserves permissions on the extracted files. Without the proper file
permissions, the installation will be broken.

Unpacking produces the directory cvs. This should be installed under
/usr. If you unpacked it somewhere else, do:

    mv cvs /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/cvs

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find CVS's files. You
should now be able to use CVS.

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading CVS
--------------------------------

If you ever want to remove CVS, follow these steps. For example, you
should do this before you install a new version of CVS. Again, you
may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to CVS from Syllable. You should
even do this when you want to upgrade CVS, because the links will
most likely have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/cvs

To delete the files belonging to CVS, run:

    rm -r /usr/cvs

3 Building CVS on Syllable
==========================

Normally you don't have to, but if you want to build CVS yourself,
you need to get the source distribution. You can get the CVS
distribution through its home page:

    http://www.cvshome.org

See the file README for details.

Now you could use

    ./configure

but this will configure make for installing CVS in /usr/local. This
is fine for local use, but to produce a distribution, I prefer

    CFLAGS="-march=i586 -O2" \
        ./configure --prefix=/usr/cvs

to target it for /usr/cvs and optimize for a Pentium processor.

Now you can do

    make

and optionally

    make check

After becoming root,

    make install

will install CVS's files. Alternatively,

    make install-strip

would strip the binaries from debugging information.

If you configured to install in /usr/cvs, you will have to let
Syllable know:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/cvs

If you had a previous installation in /usr/cvs, it would be wise to
uninstall it before running make install:

    pkgmanager -r /usr/cvs
    rm -r /usr/cvs
