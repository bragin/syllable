headline			Zero Install Injector
description
	The zero-install system makes software installation unnecessary. Users run their applications directly from the internet. Caching makes this as fast as running a normal application after the first time, and allows for off-line use.

	Zero Install is a cross-platform, decentralised installation system. Instead of having a central repository in which all software is placed under a naming scheme managed by some central authority, programs and libraries in Zero Install are identified by URIs. Anyone who can create a web-page can publish software.
Anyone can install software (not just root).

	Conceptually, you can imagine that the software is 'installed' only on a remote machine and that you are simply running it (on your own machine) using a network filesystem. Caching makes this fast and allows off-line use. The cache is indexed using a cryptographic hash, allowing it to be shared between mutually
untrusting users automatically.

	Zero Install resolves dependencies (such as libraries) on a per-program basis, which eliminates conflicts. You will never be told that installing one program requires first uninstalling another.
