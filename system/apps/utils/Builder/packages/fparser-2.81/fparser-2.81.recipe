headline			Function parser for C++
description
	Often people need to ask some mathematical expression from the user and then evaluate values for that expression. The simplest example is a program which draws the graphic of a user-defined function on screen. This library adds C-style function string parsing to the program. This means that you can evaluate the string "sqrt(1-x^2+y^2)" with given values of 'x' and 'y'.
