Zlib for Syllable/AtheOS
========================

18 February 2003

1 Introduction
==============

This is a binary distribution of version 1.1.4 of the Zlib
compression library for the Syllable operating system. This
distribution was built on Syllable 0.4.2a as a shared library, and
was optimized for a Pentium CPU. It should also run on other versions
of Syllable and on the AtheOS operating system, but this has not been
tested.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

See the file README for more information on Zlib.

2 How to install Zlib on Syllable
=================================

2.1 
----

You may have to become the root user to perform the following
operations:

    su

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xpz

or something equivalent. The 'p' option to tar is important: it
preserves permissions on the extracted files. Without the proper file
permissions, the installation will be broken.

Unpacking produces the directory zlib. This should be installed under
/usr. If you unpacked it somewhere else, do:

    mv zlib /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/zlib

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find Zlib's files.

You should now be able to link your programs with the Zlib shared
library. Note that a previous version of Zlib was distributed for
Syllable and AtheOS as a non-shared library.

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading Zlib
---------------------------------

If you ever want to remove Zlib, follow these steps. For example, you
should do this before you install a new version of Zlib. Again, you
may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to Zlib from Syllable. You should
even do this when you want to upgrade Zlib, because the links will
most likely have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/zlib

To delete the files belonging to Zlib, run:

    rm -r /usr/zlib

3 Building Zlib on Syllable
===========================

Normally you don't have to, but if you want to build Zlib yourself,
you need to get the source distribution. You can get the Zlib
distribution through its home page:

    http://www.zlib.org

See the file README for details.

Now you could use

    configure

but this will configure make for installing Zlib in /usr/local. This
is fine for local use, but to produce a distribution, I prefer

    CFLAGS="-march=i586 -O2" \
        configure --prefix=/usr/zlib --shared

to target it for /usr/zlib, optimize for a Pentium processor and
compile as a shared library.

Now you can do

    make

and optionally

    make test

After becoming root,

    make install

will install Zlib's files. If you configured to install in /usr/zlib,
you will have to let Syllable know:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/zlib

If you had a previous installation in /usr/zlib, it would be wise to
uninstall it before running make install:

    pkgmanager -r /usr/zlib
    rm -r /usr/zlib
