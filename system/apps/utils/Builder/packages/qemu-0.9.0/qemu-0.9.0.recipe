headline			Emulator and virtualizer
description
	QEMU is a generic machine emulator and virtualizer. When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made for one machine on a different machine. By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performances. When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performances by executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. A host driver called the QEMU accelerator (also known as KQEMU) is needed in this case.
