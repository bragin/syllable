headline			Relative Expression Based Object Language - graphical edition
description
	REBOL uses "relative expressions" (context dependent dialects) to create a powerful new dimension similar to that found in natural human languages.

	REBOL provides a lightweight platform for Internet applications. REBOL's power makes applications small so they are less expensive to create, distribute, maintain, and upgrade. In the size of a typical web page, you can fit an entire REBOL application.

	REBOL/View includes a fast, machine independent, hierarchical compositing engine that includes a wide range of special effects and filters, including contrast, tint, blur, sharpen, scale, gradients, colorize, emboss, and much more. View also includes the Visual Interface Dialect (VID), a flexible graphical user interface that allows users to easily create applications.
