Development files for Syllable
==============================

7-Sep-2008

1 Introduction
==============

This package contains the extra files that are needed for compiling
software on Syllable. They consist of the static libraries and
accompanying header files for components that are part of the base
system, and extra documentation for development. This distribution
contains the development files for Syllable Server 0.3. They should
not be installed on any other version of Syllable.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

2 How to install the development files on Syllable
==================================================

2.1 
---

You may have to become the root user to perform the following operations:

    su -l

Unpacking this distribution should have produced a directory with the
contained package, this README document, and an installation script.
Being the root user, go into the directory and run the install script:

    cd SyllableServer-0.3-development
    ./install.sh

The contained files pack will be unpacked into /system/development/.
Subsequently, the individual components will be registered, creating
links in Syllable to enable it to find the components' files. If any of
the component directories already existed under /system/development/,
they will be unregistered and deleted first.

To be able to compile software you should also install extra tools,
in particular the Developer's Delight collection of packages.

2.2 Uninstalling and upgrading the development files
----------------------------------------------------

After installation, the development files are effectively no longer one
package, but are merged into the base system and registered with the
components they belong to. Making any subsequent changes to them is not
explicitly supported. You can do so manually, but it falls into the
realm of system development and thus becomes your own responsibility
to know what you are doing. Changing anything is usually not required,
unless you are developing the Syllable base system itself.

You can, however, run the installation procedure for the development
files pack again to replace an existing installation, to undo any
changes that may have been made.
