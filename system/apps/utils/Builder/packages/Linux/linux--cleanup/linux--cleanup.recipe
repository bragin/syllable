	Cleans up kernel modules area in the running system after a system image installation!
	Is specific to linux-2.6.27.44-Syllable kernel!
	Assumes the host system has this same kernel!

; Overwrites the built kernel source. We don't need it again, but at least
; it prevents the huge source tree from being unregistered:
packages			linux-2.6.27.44

make				true

super-install
; Kernel should already be there:
merge-install

; Clean out kernel source link from the host system:
install				rm /lib/modules/2.6.27.44-Syllable/build

_links
;	Assume the host had this (same) kernel:
	/system/resources/Linux/2.6.27.44/lib/modules/2.6.27.44-Syllable	/lib/modules/
;	(Repair damage from Linux-Fusion:)
;	lib/modules															/lib/
;	Give the system access to modules of all kernel versions:
;	This, however, leads depmod to create module files within the symlink pool:
;	/system/indexes/lib/modules											/lib/

_delete-files
;	Clean out kernel source link from the host system:
	/lib/modules/2.6.27.44-Syllable/build
;	Source is not there any more because it's moved to Linux--cleanup, so it did not get unregistered:
	/system/indexes/lib/modules/2.6.27.44-Syllable/build
	/system/indexes/lib/modules/2.6.27.44-Syllable/source
