	Cleans up kernel modules area in the running system!
	Is specific to linux-2.6.25-Syllable kernel!
	Assumes the host system has this same kernel!

; Overwrites the built kernel source. We don't need it again, but at least
; it prevents the huge source tree from being unregistered:
packages			linux-2.6.25

; Kernel should already be there:
merge-install

make				true
install				sudo rm /lib/modules/2.6.25-Syllable/build

;	Assume the host had this (same) kernel:
	/system/resources/linux/2.6.25/lib/modules	/lib/
;	(Repair damage from Linux-Fusion:)
;	lib/modules									/lib/
;	Give the system access to modules of all kernel versions:
;	This, however, leads depmod to create module files within the symlink pool:
;	/system/indexes/lib/modules					/lib/

; Source is not there any more because it's moved to linux--cleanup, so it did not get unregistered:
_delete-files
	/system/indexes/lib/modules/2.6.25-Syllable/build
	/system/indexes/lib/modules/2.6.25-Syllable/source
