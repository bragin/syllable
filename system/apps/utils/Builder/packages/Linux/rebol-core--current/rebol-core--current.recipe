headline			Relative Expression Based Object Language
description
	REBOL uses "relative expressions" (context dependent dialects) to create a powerful new dimension similar to that found in natural human languages.
	REBOL provides a lightweight platform for Internet applications. REBOL's power makes applications small so they are less expensive to create, distribute, maintain, and upgrade. In the size of a typical web page, you can fit an entire REBOL application.
