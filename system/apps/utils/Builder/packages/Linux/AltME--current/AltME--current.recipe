description
	AltME is a powerful, lightweight communication system. It has multi-user chat, file sharing, a calendar, checklists and access permissions for secure, worldwide collaboration.

	An AltME safeworld is a private world of instant communication that can run from your own computer (rather than from AOL, MSN, or ICQ's computers). In a way, it's like having your own private AOL system. It runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows, so you can communicate with people using those systems.
