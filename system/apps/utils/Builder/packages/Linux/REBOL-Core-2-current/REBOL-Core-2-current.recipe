headline			Relative Expression Based Object Language - command line edition
description
	REBOL uses "relative expressions" (context dependent dialects) to create a powerful new dimension similar to that found in natural human languages.

	REBOL provides a lightweight platform for Internet applications. REBOL's power makes applications small so they are less expensive to create, distribute, maintain, and upgrade. In the size of a typical web page, you can fit an entire REBOL application.

	REBOL/Core is the kernel of the REBOL distributed computing platform. Designed for the semantic exchange and interpretation of information REBOL/Core is the engine that powers all REBOL products. REBOL/Core provides system-independent code, a common data model, compression, and more than a dozen Internet protocols built-in.
