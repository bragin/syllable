	Freedroid exists in two flavors: - FreedroidClassic is a 2D arcade game similar to Paradroid - FreedroidRPG is an original isometric 3D role playing game inspired from Diablo and Fallout, taking place in the future, on Earth.
	In this game, you control a robot, depicted by a small white ball with a few numbers within an interstellar spaceship consisting of several decks connected by elevators. The aim of the game is to destroy all enemy robots, depicted by small black balls with a few numbers, by either shooting them or seizing control over them by creating connections in a short subgame of electric circuits.
