headline			Client/server network programming framework for REBOL
description
	UniServe is a client/server network programming framework for REBOL. It has been designed and built in order to offer a high performance network engine while providing a simple and consistent API for developers. If you want to implement a client or server or both (in the same application) in REBOL, UniServe will be a perfect fit and will save you days of hard work on low-level I/O routines. Additionally, UniServe is published with several useful services (HTTPd, Proxy, Task-Master,...) and client protocols (HTTP, POP3, DNS, ...) to help you build your product even faster.
