headline			Emulator and virtualiser
description
	QEMU is a generic machine emulator and virtualiser. When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made for one machine on a different machine. By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance. When used as a virtualiser, QEMU achieves near native performance by executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. A host driver called the QEMU accelerator (also known as KQEMU) is needed in this case.
