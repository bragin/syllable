Ruby for Syllable
=================

6-Feb-2005

1 Introduction
==============

This is a binary distribution of version 1.8.2 of the Ruby
programming language for the Syllable operating system. This
distribution was built on Syllable 0.5.6 with GCC 3.4.3, and was
optimized for a Pentium CPU.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

See the file README for more information on Ruby.

2 How to install Ruby on Syllable
=================================

2.1 
----

2.1.1 
------

You may have to become the root user to perform the following
operations:

    su

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xpz

or something equivalent. The 'p' option to tar is important: it
preserves permissions on the extracted files. Without the proper file
permissions, the installation will be broken.

Unpacking produces the directory ruby. This should be installed under
/usr. If you unpacked it somewhere else, do:

    mv ruby /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/ruby

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find Ruby's files. You
should now be able to start Ruby; for example:

    ruby -v

(You may have to restart your shell/terminal program first.)

2.1.2 Installing with the Syllable build system
-----------------------------------------------

If you have the Syllable build system installed, it can do the above
steps for you. Just do:

    su
    build install ruby-1.8.1.bin.1.tgz

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading Ruby
---------------------------------

2.2.1 
------

If you ever want to remove Ruby, follow these steps. For example, you
should do this before you install a new version of Ruby. Again, you
may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to Ruby from Syllable. You should
even do this when you want to upgrade Ruby, because the links will
most likely have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/ruby

To delete the files belonging to Ruby, run:

    rm -r /usr/ruby

2.2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading with the Syllable build system
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you install a package with the Syllable build system, it will
check if the package was already installed and remove the previous
version automatically.

If you just want to uninstall Ruby, do:

    su
    build uninstall ruby

2.3 Getting started with sample scripts
---------------------------------------

/usr/ruby/sample contains some sample Ruby programs. Note that most
scripts don't run as is, because they contain a hardcoded path to the
Ruby executable in the first line of the script. This is unfortunate,
as this location varies among installations (Syllable likes to put it
in /usr/ruby/bin). You can change the first line of the scripts, or
you can run them like this:

    ruby sample.rb

When writing your own scripts, you could keep them portable by not
hardcoding a path in the first line:

    #! ruby

Have fun!

3 Building Ruby on Syllable
===========================

Normally you don't have to, but if you want to compile Ruby yourself,
you need to get the source distribution. You can get the Ruby
distribution through its home page:

    http://www.ruby-lang.org

See the file README for details. Additionally, you need patches to
the source that are specific to Syllable. These patches are kept in
the Syllable build system. The build system also knows all other
specifics for building Ruby.

When you have the build system installed, you should first provide it
with the Ruby source package:

    cp ruby-1.8.2.tar.gz /usr/Builder/sources/

To configure and compile Ruby, do

    build ruby-1.8.2

from your work directory. If that succeeds, you can optionally run
the testsuite:

    build test ruby-1.8.2

To install and register the package, become root first:

    su

then do:

    build install ruby-1.8.2

After the installation, you could even create a distribution package:

    build distro ruby-1.8.2

4 Known problems and limitations
================================

Obviously, features that are not implemented in Syllable (yet) will
not work from Ruby.
