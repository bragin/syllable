Developer Pack for Syllable
===========================

30-Jun-2004

1 Introduction
==============

This distribution is a collection of the most important binary
packages a software developer would want for the Syllable operating
system. Most of the packages were built on Syllable 0.5.3 and
optimized for a Pentium CPU. Several of the packages do not work on
older versions of Syllable, but they should run on higher versions,
although this has not been tested.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

2 How to install the Developer Pack on Syllable
===============================================

2.1 
----

Please note that if you want to use AutoConf or AutoMake, you should
install Perl separately.

Now for the developer pack installation. You may have to become the
root user to perform the following operations:

    su -l

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xz

or something equivalent. Unpacking produces a directory with the
contained packages, this README document, and an install script.
Being the root user, go into the directory and run the install script:

    cd DevelopersDelight
    ./install.sh

The individual packages will be unpacked into /usr. Subsequently, the
packages will be registered, creating links in Syllable to enable it
to find the packages' files. If any of the package directories
already existed under /usr, they will be unregistered and deleted
first. Please note, though, that no version of any of the packages
should be previously registered with a different directory name under
/usr, because that would lead to conflicting package registrations.

You should now be able to use the programs in the developer pack.

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading the Developer Pack
-----------------------------------------------

2.2.1 
------

After installation, the developer pack is effectively no longer one
package, but the individual packages it contained. If you ever want
to remove one or more of those packages, you should follow the steps
outlined in the respective README.Syllable documents that are
included in most packages. Usually, you will have to follow the
standard procedure. Again, you may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to the package from Syllable.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/<package>

To delete the files belonging to the package, run:

    rm -r /usr/<package>

2.2.2 Uninstalling individual packages with the Syllable build system
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have the Syllable build system installed, it can do the
previous steps for you. Also, if you install an individual package
with the Syllable build system, it will check if the package was
already installed and remove the previous version automatically.

If you just want to uninstall an individual package, do:

    su
    build uninstall <package>

2.2.3 Upgrading the entire Developer Pack
-----------------------------------------

Upgrading to a new version of the developer pack is easy, since the
install script will remove the existing packages and replace them
with the new ones.

3 Known problems and limitations
================================

Please refer to the respective README and README.Syllable documents
that are included in each separate package.
