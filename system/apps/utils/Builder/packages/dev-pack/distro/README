Developer Pack for Syllable
===========================

17-Mar-2007

1 Introduction
==============

This distribution is a collection of the most important binary
packages a software developer would want for the Syllable operating
system. Most packages were built on Syllable 0.6.3, and they were
optimized for a Pentium CPU. They may also run on earlier versions of
Syllable, but this has not been tested.

For additional functionality, it is recommended to also install
other collection packs available for Syllable.

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

2 How to install the Developer Pack on Syllable
===============================================

2.1 
---

You may have to become the root user to perform the following operations:

    su -l

Unpacking this distribution should have produced a directory with the
contained packages, this README document, and an install script.
Being the root user, go into the directory and run the install script:

    cd DevelopersDelight
    ./install.sh

The individual packages will be unpacked into /usr/. Subsequently, the
packages will be registered, creating links in Syllable to enable it
to find the packages' files. If any of the package directories
already existed under /usr/, they will be unregistered and deleted
first. Please note, though, that no version of any of the packages
should be previously registered with a different directory name under
/usr/, because that would lead to conflicting package registrations.

You should now be able to use the programs in the developer pack. You
are advised to update Builder, the Syllable build system, via the
Internet, to get the latest version. Further on you can read how to
do that.

2.2 Uninstalling and upgrading the Developer Pack
-------------------------------------------------

2.2.1 
-----

After installation, the developer pack is effectively no longer one
package, but the individual packages it contained. If you ever want
to remove one or more of those packages, you should execute the
following procedure for each package. Again, you may have to become
root first:

    su -l

Then you should remove the links to the package from Syllable.

    package unregister <package>

To delete the files belonging to the package, run:

    rm -r /usr/<package>

2.2.2 Uninstalling individual packages with the Syllable build system
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Since you have the Syllable build system installed from this
developer pack, you can use it to do the previous steps for you.
Also, if you install an individual package with the Syllable build
system, it will check if the package was already installed and will
remove the previous version automatically.

If you just want to uninstall an individual package, do:

    su -l
    build uninstall <package>

2.2.3 Upgrading the entire Developer Pack
-----------------------------------------

Upgrading to a new version of the developer pack is easy, since the
install script will remove the existing packages and replace them
with the new ones.

2.2.4 Updating the Syllable build system, Builder
-------------------------------------------------

The Builder package in this developer pack has the form of an
anonymous CVS checkout. This means that you can update it to the
latest version from the Syllable CVS repository on the Internet. You
are strongly encouraged to do this with some regularity if you use
Builder, because it and its package definitions change regularly and
match the current Syllable development. This is how to do it:

    build update
    build log

If you have made your own changes to some of Builder's files - in the
settings or the ports tree, perhaps - you should look in the log for
conflicts. If there was an updated version for a file you changed,
you should solve the conflict.

3 Known problems and limitations
================================

Please refer to the respective README and possibly README.Syllable
documents that are included in each separate package.
