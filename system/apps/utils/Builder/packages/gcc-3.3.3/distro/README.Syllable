GCC for Syllable
================

21 March 2004

1 Introduction
==============

This is a binary distribution of version 3.3.3 of the GNU compiler
collection for the Syllable operating system. This distribution was
built on Syllable 0.5.2, and was optimized for a Pentium CPU. It
requires version 0.5.2a of Syllable, or newer. It supports only the C
and C++ languages. The compiler defaults to generating Pentium code
(default --march=i586).

If you encounter problems or have any other interesting observations,
I would be interested to hear about them (see contact information).

See the file README for more information on GCC.

2 How to install GCC on Syllable
================================

2.1 
----

2.1.1 
------

Please note that GCC needs the BinUtils package, which is not
included in this distribution, so you have to get that package and
install it first.

Now for the GCC installation. You may have to become the root user to
perform the following operations:

    su

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xpz

or something equivalent. The 'p' option to Tar is important: it
preserves permissions on the extracted files. Without the proper file
permissions, the installation will be broken.

Unpacking produces the directory gcc. This should be installed under
/usr. If you unpacked it somewhere else, do:

    mv gcc /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/gcc

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find GCC's files. You
should now be able to use GCC.

2.1.2 Installing with the Syllable build system
-----------------------------------------------

If you have the Syllable build system installed, it can do the above
steps for you. Just do:

    su
    build install gcc-3.3.3.bin.1.tgz

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading GCC
--------------------------------

2.2.1 
------

If you ever want to remove GCC, follow these steps. For example, you
should do this before you install a new version of GCC. Again, you
may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to GCC from Syllable. You should
even do this when you want to upgrade GCC, because the links will
most likely have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/gcc

To delete the files belonging to GCC, run:

    rm -r /usr/gcc

2.2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading with the Syllable build system
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you install a package with the Syllable build system, it will
check if the package was already installed and remove the previous
version automatically.

If you just want to uninstall GCC, do:

    su
    build uninstall gcc

3 Building GCC on Syllable
==========================

Normally you don't have to, but if you want to build GCC yourself,
you need to get the source distribution. You can get the GCC
distribution through its home page:

    http://gcc.gnu.org

Additionally, you need patches to the source that are specific to
Syllable. These patches are kept in the Syllable build system. The
build system also knows all other specifics for building GCC.

When you have the build system installed, you should first provide it
with the GCC source package:

    cp gcc-3.3.3.tar.bz2 /Applications/Builder/sources

You may alternatively use a GZipped package, if you have that.

To configure and compile GCC, do

    build gcc-3.3.3

from your work directory. If that succeeds, you can optionally run
the testsuite:

    build test gcc-3.3.3

To install and register the package, become root first:

    su

then do:

    build install gcc-3.3.3

After the installation, you could even create a distribution package:

    build distro gcc-3.3.3

4 Contact information
=====================

GCC was originally ported to AtheOS by Kurt Skauen. That port was
reconstructed and adapted to Syllable by Kaj de Vos. The port of GCC 3
was done by Arno Klenke, and finalized by Kristian Van Der Vliet
and Kaj de Vos. This distribution was built and packed for Syllable
by Kaj de Vos. You can send me problem reports, fixes and the like at

    gcc@syllable.info

This distribution can be found in the download section of the
Syllable web site:
