	The source package contains hard links. This fails on Syllable of course, but the source is installed, so you have to patch the source separately and continue the build:
	build get lmarbles-1.0.7
	build patch lmarbles-1.0.7
	build lmarbles-1.0.7
notes				May need older LibOGG and LibVorbis

headline			Atomix-like puzzle game
description
	LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in concept. Instead of assembling molecules you create figures out of marbles. Nevertheless, the basic game play is the same: If a marble starts to move it will not stop until it hits a wall or another marble. To make it more interesting there are obstacles like one-way streets, crumbling walls and portals. As Marbles is meant as a puzzle game you play against a move limit and not a time limit. This way you have as much time as you need to think.
