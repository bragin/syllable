description
	GTK-Doc is used to document C code. It is typically used to document the public API of libraries, such as the GTK+ and GNOME libraries, but it can also be used to document application code.

	Note that GTK-Doc wasn't originally intended to be a general-purpose documentation tool, so it can be a bit awkward to setup and use. For a more polished general-purpose documentation tool you may want to look at Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/). However GTK-Doc has some special code to document the signals and properties of GTK+ widgets and GObject classes which other tools may not have.
