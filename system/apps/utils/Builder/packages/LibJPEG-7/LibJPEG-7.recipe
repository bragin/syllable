headline			JPEG image compression library
description
	Widely used free library for JPEG image compression.
	This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding, and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.
	This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet. We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless
processes defined in the standard.
