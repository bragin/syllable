notes
	Patch contains two changed files from the vidix directory. I had to comment out disable_io_os() / enable_io_os(). I have no clue what might be broken now, but it compiles and works for some movies.
	Won't play MP3 even with LibMAD.

; Need to free up registers for inline assembler:
; For FFMPEG:
;configure-env		CFLAGS "$CFLAGS -fomit-frame-pointer"
; For LibMPCodecs:
;make-env			CFLAGS "$CFLAGS -fno-pic"
make-env			CFLAGS "$CFLAGS -fno-pic -fomit-frame-pointer"
