	Is incompatible with Syllable's BinaryUtilities version.
	Genode binary toolchain distribution needs GLibC >= 2.8, so it doesn't work on Server <= 0.4.

headline			Capabilities-based operating system framework
description
	Genode is a novel operating-system architecture that enables dynamic workload while retaining security and robustness. The fundamental difference of Genode compared to other OS architectures is its strict organizational structure, which allows the execution of sensitive applications with a trusted computing base of a few thousand lines of code beside high-complexity workload. With its organizational approach, the architecture facilitates a clean separation of policies and mechanisms, and enables the definition and application of system policies in a natural and distributed fashion. Genode's resource-management concept enables highly dynamic workload but still retains deterministic behaviour normally only found in statically configured systems.
