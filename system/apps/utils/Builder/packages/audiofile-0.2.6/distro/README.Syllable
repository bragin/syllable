audiofile for Syllable
========================

14 October 2004

1 Introduction
==============

This is a binary distribution of the audiofile library.

Apparently two tests fail during 'make check', but I have
no knowledge of how to fix them or if they are important.
I'm guessing if you run into problems due to them, you'll
know how to fix it.

See the file README for more information on audiofile.

2 How to install audiofile on Syllable
=================================

2.1 
----

You may have to become the root user to perform the following
operations:

    su

You should have unpacked this file with

    tar -xpz

or something equivalent. The 'p' option to tar is important: it
preserves permissions on the extracted files. Without the proper file
permissions, the installation will be broken.

Unpacking produces the directory audiofile. This should be installed under
/usr. If you unpacked it somewhere else, do:

    mv audiofile /usr

Then run:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/audiofile

This creates links in Syllable to enable it to find audiofile's files.

You should now be able to link your programs with the audiofile library
and run the various utilities from a terminal. 

2.2 Uninstalling & upgrading audiofile
---------------------------------

If you ever want to remove audiofile, follow these steps. For example, you
should do this before you install a new version of audiofile. Again, you
may have to become root first:

    su

Then you should remove the links to audiofile from Syllable. You should
even do this when you want to upgrade audiofile, because the links will
most likely have changed for the new version.

    pkgmanager -r /usr/audiofile

To delete the files belonging to audiofile, run:

    rm -r /usr/audiofile

3 Building audiofile on Syllable
===========================

Normally you don't have to, but if you want to build audiofile yourself,
you need to get the source distribution. You can get the audiofile
distribution through its home page:

    http://www.68k.org/~michael/audiofile/

See the file README for details.

    configure --prefix=/usr/audiofile

to target it for /usr/audiofile.

Now you can do

    make

and optionally

    make check

After becoming root,

    make install

will install audiofile's files. If you configured to install in /usr/audiofile,
you will have to let Syllable know:

    pkgmanager -a /usr/audiofile

If you had a previous installation in /usr/audiofile, it would be wise to
uninstall it before running make install:

    pkgmanager -r /usr/audiofile
    rm -r /usr/audiofile
