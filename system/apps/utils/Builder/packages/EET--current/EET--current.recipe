headline			Enlightenment's file chunk reading/writing library
description
	EET is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on. EET files are perfect for storing data that is written once (or rarely) and read many times, especially when the program does not want to have to read all the data in at once.

	Use this library when you need to pack C structure and you want to retrieve it quickly with as few as possible memory use. You can also use it to serialize data quickly and exchange them between two program over ipc or network link.
