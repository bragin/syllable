#	Syllable keymaps names database for Keyboard preferences application.

# "Filename" is the name of a keymap in /system/keymaps/ .
# "Displayname" is the name that will be displayed in the Keyboard preferences application's menu.
#  If no Displayname is defined in that column, the listed Filename will be defined as the
#  Displayname.
#  "Aliases" are additional names which the keymap will be represented by in the preferences
# application menu. Separate with commas.
#  * = the keymap is marked to display at the top of the Keyboard preferences application's menu.
#  Do this for the layouts usually associated with the locale this keymaps.db is translated for.
#
#  Eg:
#Fruit-keymap							Apple, Pear, Banana
#  would represent the Fruit-keymap with these three items in the keymaps preference's list.
#
#  Translating keymap display names goes simply as follows: 
#Fruit-keymap							Pomme, Poire, Banane

# If the preferences application doesn't find a displayname defined for a keymap in the
# selected language's keymaps names database, it will fallback to checking the keymap
# file's metadata to see whether one has been defined there. This permits the distribution
# of new keymaps which can display their names correctly and in multiple languages
# without any system modification. If no displayname is found in metadata for the language
# being used by the preferences application, it will fallback to displaying the
# keymap's file's name.


# Additional filenames should be added to the end of the list to ease translation co-ordination.
