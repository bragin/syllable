About
-----

This version of Launcher is a complete departure from the 0.x versions. It is build around a Plugin system where all the items visible in the Window are loadable modules that can be added, deleted and moved about at will.

Currently there are 5 plugins:

	LauncherBar: A box full of buttons that do the actual "launching" - it looks like the original Launcher.
    LauncherIcon: Similar to the LauncherBar but it simply displays an icon in the LauncherWindow.
    Clock: A clock.
    CPU: A CPU load meter.
    Mem: A Memory usage meter.

The default config has most of them installed. Try right-clicking on stuff to see what it does.

If you are interested in writing your own plugin please read the file Developers and have a look the the source code to the existing plugins as well as liblauncher.

This package includes the following programs:

	launcher - The actual Launcher program.
	LBrowser - A simple file manager.
	AddLauncherIcon - a CLI tool for setting the LAUNCHER_ICON attribute of a file or directory.


Installation
------------

make
make install
pkgmanager -a /Applications/Launcher


Configuration
-------------

The config information is stored in ~/config/Launcher/Launcher1.cfg. Unlike earlier versions, which used a plain text file, this file is a flattened Message and cannot be edited by hand.

To change the preferences of a Window right-click on it's arrow and select Preferences from the menu. The preferences window contains two tabs - Position and Plugins.

The Position tab displays a widget for setting the position and alignment of the Window on the screen as well as two checkboxes that set the automatic hide/show behaviour of the Window.

The Plugins tab contains a list of the available plugins. Clicking on one will display some information about it. The Add button will add a new instance of the currently selected plugins to the Window.


Icons
-----

The LauncherBar and LauncherIcon plugins look for an attribute called LAUNCHER_ICON in each of the files or directories they try to list. This attribute is expected to be a string containing the name of an image file. 

The icon can be set with either the AddLauncherIcon program or the LBrowser file manager.


Mime Types
----------

Support for mime-types is a new feature in Launcher 1.1. 

Information about the types are stored in <LauncherDir>/mime. There is a sub directory for each type of data, audio, image, text and video. Within these directories is a file for each recognised file type. This file looks like this:

	DefaultCommand=/usr/aedit/bin/aedit %f
	DefaultIcon=/Applications/Launcher/icons/file.png
	Match=\.txt$
	Match=\.text$
	Match=^README$

This is the information for text/plain. 

The DefaultCommand line is the command to use when opening the file. %f is replaced with that full path to the file.

DefaultIcon is the path of an icon to use for the file if it does not already have one set.

The Match lines contain regexps for matching the file.
