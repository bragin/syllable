# Installing from the Source:
#
# This file is also a shell script, which you can run to do the install
# for you.  Type 'sh INSTALL /dest/dir' at the command line to install
# under /dest/dir.  If you leave out this parameter, the default directory
# is /Applications/Users.
#
# In order to build this program you will need to have the GCC and binutils
# packages installed as well as the PNG and zlib libraries (PNG typically
# relies on zlib).
# 
# If these elements are all set up, you can build the executable with:
# 
#  % make
#
# and then copy the executable into its application directory.  You will
# need to make a subdirectory of that application directory named 'share'
# and copy in the graphic file 'keys.png'.  If you intend to use pkgmanager
# to create links for command line use, you will further need to create
# a 'bin' directory under the application directory that contains a link
# to the executable.
#
# In order for the file to run properly, it must be installed with the user
# set to 'root' and the application marked 'setuid'.  Otherwise, people will
# not be able to change their passwords, on root will.
