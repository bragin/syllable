There are two tarballs in this directory.  Both are untarred into
$DIST_DIR/atheos/sys/libs/ at build time, which is /atheos/sys/libs
at runtime.

sys-compat.bin.tgz contains older versions of libatheos and libgui, 
required for binary compatibility with older software, while
libc-compat.bin.tgz contains all of the binary libraries from glibc-2.1.2

The files are stored within a tarball in order to preserve symlinks through
the CVS Repository, which is important!  If you need to change either of
these tarballs, untar into an empty directory on an AFS partition someplace
with:

$ tar -xzpf tarball.bin.tgz

Make your changes, and then re-tar with:

$ tar -czpf tarball.bin.tgz *
