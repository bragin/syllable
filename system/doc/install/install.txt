		1. WILL SYLLABLE RUN ON MY COMPUTER?

Syllable is designed to run on modern Intel compatible PC's.  At a minimum,
your machine must have at least a Pentium compatible processor and 40 MB of
memory, but a faster processor and 128 MB of memory or more will allow
Syllable to do more and run faster.

Most common home computer motherboards, video cards and networks cards are
supported.  Many common sound cards also work, and some USB devices are also
supported.  For a comprehensive list of hardware which is known to work with
Syllable, you should check the hardware compatibility list at
http://www.syllable-hardware.info  If your particular hardware is not listed there,
it does not mean that your hardware will not work.  You can still try to
install Syllable; the worst thing that will happen is that it simply will not
run.



		2. INSTALLING SYLLABLE

Syllable is normally installed from a bootable CD which is a simple
and painless way to install Syllable.  You can either download a disc
image and burn a CD yourself, or you can purchase a CD for $10.

A purchased CD is the same as the downloadable disc image but also includes
the latest available applications and full sourcecode for Syllable.  If
you purchase a CD you will be helping to support.  See
http://syllable.sourceforge.net/modules.php?name=buy for more information.

The downloadable Syllable CD image is distributed as a Gziped "ISO" image.
Before you can burn this image to a CD you must first ungzip it.  On Linux,
Syllable or other Unix-like systems such as MacOS X you should do this:

bash$ gzip -d syllable-0.6.3.iso.gz

On Windows you can use WinZip to decompress the Gzip file.

Once you have decompressed the ISO disc image you must burn it to a CD
using your preferred burning software E.g. cdrecord on Linux or Nero on
Windows.  There are no special requirements for burning the Syllable CD
image; it is a standard ISO9660 disc image which any disc burning software
will be able to burn.

Once you have burnt Syllable to CD you may boot your computer with it.
The CD will start the installation scripts automatically.  Simply follow
the instructions to install Syllable to your hard drive.

Once Syllable has been installed to your hard drive you must configure the Grub 
bootloader.  See section 3. "CONFIGURING THE BOOTLOADER"



		3. CONFIGURING THE BOOTLOADER

The next step is to configure and install the bootloader.

First you must tell GRUB where to find the kernel and the required
disk/FS drivers to load before booting Syllable. This information is
found in "/inst/boot/grub/menu.lst". If you have other OS's installed
on the machine you must either configure GRUB as a boot-manager or
install another boot-manager that can "chainload" GRUB from the AFS
partition.

The menu.lst file should look something like this to boot Syllable from
the installation described above:

     title  Syllable
     root   (hd0,1)
     kernel /system/kernel.so root=/dev/disk/ata/hda/1
     module /system/config/kernel.cfg
     module /system/drivers/dev/bus/acpi
     module /system/drivers/dev/bus/pci
     module /system/drivers/dev/bus/ata
     module /system/drivers/dev/hcd/ata_pci
     module /system/drivers/fs/afs

This will tell GRUB to boot partition number 2 on the first drive
through the "root (hd0,1)" command and where to find the kernel, the
boot block-device driver and the boot-FS driver on that partition. The
"root=/dev/disk/ide/hda/1" string after the kernel-path is a parameter
that is passed to the kernel and tells what partition to mount as
/boot/ before continue to boot. The kernel can also take a number of
other parameters (listed below) that are given in the same manner after
the "root" param.

If you install Syllable on the second partition on the first drive the
default config-file is OK. otherwise you must edit the "root (disk,partition)
line to fit your setup. If you want to boot other OS's with GRUB you
must add them to the config file as well. For example to boot BeOS, or
Windows, or most other OS's that have a bootblock you can use the
"chainloader" command like this:

     title BeOS
     chainloader (hd0,3)+1

This will add a menu entry titled BeOS that will boot the OS
found on the fourth partition on the first disk.

You can also set a timeout for when to boot the first OS in the list
(or the default as set by the "default" command) with the "timeout"
command:

     timeout 5



		3.1. INSTALLING THE BOOTLOADER

When done editing the config file you must reboot the computer by
pressing <CTRL>, <ALT>, and <DEL> simultaneously (DO NOT HIT THE RESET
OR POWER BUTTON. THIS WILL CAUSE CACHED DATA THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN
WRITTEN TO THE DISK TO BE LOST AND THE INSTALLATION TO BE CORRUPTED!)
boot from the CD or first floppy disk again to install the bootloader.
This time you should abort GRUB before it boot Syllable by hitting <ESC>
and then hit "C" to enter the GRUB shell from which you can finish the
install.

Now you must decide whether you want to install GRUB in the MBR
(Master Boot Record) of the first drive and use it as a boot-manager
(or if Syllable is the only OS on the machine) or if you want to install
it on the AFS partition only and use another bootmanager select what
OS to boot.

In either case you must tell GRUB where to find the config file and
the second-stage loader by setting a "root" partition:

root (hd0,1)

If you did not install Syllable on the second partition on the first
disk you must change the parameters accordingly.

Then you must install the boot-loader with the "setup" command.

To install on a MBR of the first drive run:

setup (hd0)

To install it on the AFS partition only run:

setup (hd0,1) (again change the parameters according to your setup)

Now it should be possible to boot Syllable off the native partition.



		3.1.1. NOTES ON GRUB


GRUB understands the AFS filesystem and can boot any kernel located on
an AFS partition by changing the "kernel" line in the config file or
by manually loading the kernel and required modules from the GRUB
shell. There is no need to run any tools to update block-lists or
anything like that after installing new kernels.

Read the GRUB documentation <http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html>
and use the "help" command in the GRUB shell for more information on the
bootloader.



		4. FIRST BOOT


The first time you boot Syllable it will probe your computer to find drivers
for your hardware.  If a driver is found which supports some piece of hardware
the driver will be loaded automatically.

When all of the drivers are available Syllable will start the graphical user
interface.  You will see a single window in the centre of the screen with two
input fields and a "Login" button.

Before you will be able to do anything you will have to log in using a
user-name and a password. The base-installation comes with one predefined user,
"root"  with the password "root".  This is the super-user and has unrestricted
access to the system.

If something went wrong or Syllable failed to boot, please read section 3.2 of this
document ("SOLVING PROBLEMS").



		4.1. WHAT CAN I DO NOW?


You should read the Welcome text, which can be found in the following locations:

	On line at http://www.syllable.org/docs/latest/welcome.txt
	On the installation CD at Documentation/welcome.txt
	In Syllable at /atheos/Documentation/welcome.txt

The Welcome file contains information on Syllable websites, mailing lists,
software and hardware and will help you to get started with Syllable.



		4.2. SOLVING PROBLEMS
		

If Syllable has failed to install or you cannot boot Syllable there are various places
you can try for help and solutions to common problems.  Please read the Welcome file;
see section 3.1 of this file ("WHAT CAN I DO NOW?") for more information.

If there is a problem, the first thing you should do is try to narrow it down.  What
has gone wrong?  Did the CD fail to boot?  Was Syllable unable to find your hard drive?
Did the graphical user interface fail to start?  Collect any error messages that you see;
these will be useful in helping to solve your problem.  Make a note of your hardware
(Processor & motherboard type, total amount of memory, type of video card).

You should then check the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) at
http://www.syllable.org/faq.php  These provide answers to very
common questions concerning Syllable.  There is also a community-maintained FAQ at
http://www.syllable-wiki.tk/ which may also answer your questions.

If you are sure it is a problem with Syllable check the Forums at
http://www.syllable.org/forum.php  Someone may already have
had the same problem as you and received a solution!

Finally, if none of those help, ask on the Syllable Developer mailing list.  You must
first subscribe to this list.  See
http://www.syllable.org/mailing_lists.php for information on
how to subscribe.
