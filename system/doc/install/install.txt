		1. WILL SYLLABLE RUN ON MY COMPUTER?

Syllable is designed to run on modern Intel compatable PC's.  At a minimum,
your machine must have at least a Pentium compatable processor and 32Mb of
memory, but a faster processor and 128Mb of memory or more will allow
Syllable to do more and run faster.

Most common home computer motherboards, video cards and networks cards are
supported.  Many common sound cards also work, and some USB devices are also
supported.  For a comprehensive list of hardware which is known to work with
Syllable, you should check the hardware compatability list on the Azaka website
at http://azaka.nutus.com.ar  If your particular hardware is not listed there,
it does not mean that your hardware will not work.  You can still try to
install Syllable; the worst thing that will happen is that it simply will not
run.



		2. INSTALLING SYLLABLE

You can install Syllable from a bootable CD.  You can either purchase
a CD for $10 or burn your own CD.  Please see section 2.1 for more
information.

If for some reason you cannot boot from a CD you may be able to install
Syllable by booting from a set of floppy disks.  Please see section 2.2
for more information.



		2.1. INSTALLING FROM THE CD

Syllable is normally installed from a bootable CD which is a simple
and painless way to install Syllable.  You can either download a disc
image and burn a CD yourself, or you can purchase a CD for $10.

A purchased CD is the same as the downloadable disc image but also includes
the latest available applications and full sourcecode for Syllable.  If
you purchase a CD you will be helping to support.  See
http://syllable.sourceforge.net/modules.php?name=buy for more information.

The downloadable Syllable CD image is distributed as a Gziped "ISO" image.
Before you can burn this image to a CD you must first ungzip it.  On Linux,
Syllable or other Unix-like systems such as MacOS X you should do this:

bash$ gzip -d 0.5.3-basic.iso.gz

On Windows you can use WinZip to decompress the Gzip file.

Once you have decompressed the ISO disc image you must burn it to a CD
using your preferred burning software E.g. cdrecord on Linux or Nero on
Windows.  There are no special requirements for burning the Syllable CD
image; it is a standard ISO9660 disc image which any disc burning software
will be able to burn.

Once you have burnt Syllable to CD you may boot your computer with it.
The CD will start the installation scripts automatically.  Simply follow
the instructions to install Syllable to your hard drive.

Once Syllable has been installed to your hard drive you must configure the Grub 
bootloader.  See section 3. "CONFIGURING THE BOOTLOADER"



		2.2. INSTALLING FROM FLOPPY DISKS

First you must write the floppy disk images to a set of three
floppy disks. From Linux, BeOS, Syllable, and most other OS's you can do
this with "dd" from a shell. On Windows you will need a special
program that can write a raw disk image to a floppy. There is a
free utility named "rawrite" that can be used to create the floppies
under Windows.

After creating the boot-floppies you should be able to boot Syllable
and continue with the installation.

If you don't already have a partition ready for the AFS filesystem you
must first create one with the "DiskManager" tool that is included on
the boot floppies. Just run "DiskManager &" from the shell. The
partition editor has a fairly self-explanatory GUI where you first
select the disk to edit and then edit the partitions either
graphically by dragging the partition indicators or by explicitly
typing start and end positions for each partition.

Then you must get access to the archive containing the installation.
There are several ways to do this. If possible the best way to
achieve this is to put the base-syllable-#.#.#.tgz file on a FAT
partition before booting Syllable and then mount that partition under
Syllable. If you don't have a FAT partition and are not able to create
one you must resort to floppy disks. You must then split the archive
into files that can fit on a floppy. The simplest way to do this is
probably to write the segments to raw floppies, but you can also make
a FAT filesystem on the floppy and put each segment as a normal file
inside that FS (it will be annoying to mount/copy/unmount all the
floppies under Syllable though).

To mount a FAT partition you must first make a mount-point and then
mount the right partition. A mount-point is simply a directory and
can be made with "mkdir". To mount the partition you must first figure
out what the path is for that partition inside the /dev/ directory
hierarchy and then mount it with the "mount" command.

The /dev/ directory in Syllable is not flat like for example under Linux
but hierarchical, and the disk block-devices are located under /dev/disk/.

Currently the only driver available when you boot from the floppy disks
is the BIOS disk-device so all disks are located under /dev/disk/bios/
and are named hda, hdb, hdc, etc etc.  These disk-names are themselves
directories that contain the actual device nodes. Under each drive you
will find at least one node named "raw" that represent the whole disk
and if the disk has a valid partition table you will find one node for
each partition named "0", "1", etc etc. So to get the second partition
on the third drive you will have to write /dev/disk/bios/hdc/1 (partition
numbers start at 0).  The disks are listed in the order they were reported
by the BIOS so drive 0x80 is hda, 0x81 is hdb and so on.

In the following example I will assume that the base archive is
located at /download/syllable-base-0.4.2.tgz on a FAT partition on the
first partition (0) on the first drive (hda) and that we want to
install the OS on the second partition (1) on the first drive (still
hda :).



		2.2.1. INSTALLING THE OS FILES

First we make a mount-point for the FAT partition and mount it:

bash-2.03$ mkdir dos
bash-2.03$ mount /dev/disk/bios/hda/0 dos

Then we must create and mount the native FS, be 100% sure you select
the right partition before formatting it.  There is a couple of tools
on the floppy that can help you find the right partition. To find an
existing filesystem you can use "fsprobe".  "fsprobe" takes a block-device
path as it's only parameter and will ask each filesystem driver if they
recognise the partition and, if one of them do, it will print the FS-type,
the volume label and some size/usage stats. The other tool is "devstat"
that also takes a block-device path and prints the size and geometry of
the disk/partition.  This can be useful to verify that the partition you
are about to format is really the one you intend to format.

Once you have found the partition you intend to use, you must format and
mount it:

bash-2.03$ format /dev/disk/bios/hda/1 afs MySyllablePartition
bash-2.03$ mkdir afs
bash-2.03$ mount /dev/disk/bios/hda/1 afs

Now we are ready to unpack the base archive to install the FS:

bash-2.03$ cd /afs
bash-2.03$ tar -xvpzf /dos/download/syllable-base-0.4.2.tgz

This should create an "syllable" directory containing well... Syllable and a
"boot" directory containing the GRUB bootloader inside the /afs/
mount-point.

You must manually configure the GRUB boot loader.  See section 2 for more
information.  To edit the GRUB config file you can use "aedit" which is a
easy-to-use text editor included on the boot-floppies.


		3. CONFIGURING THE BOOTLOADER

The next step is to configure and install the bootloader.

First you must tell GRUB where to find the kernel and the required
disk/FS drivers to load before booting Syllable. This information is
found in "/afs/boot/grub/menu.lst". If you have other OS's installed
on the machine you must either configure GRUB as a boot-manager or
install another boot-manager that can "chainload" GRUB from the AFS
partition.

The menu.lst file should look something like this to boot Syllable from
the installation described above:

     title  Syllable
     root   (hd0,1)
     kernel /atheos/sys/kernel.so root=/dev/disk/ide/hda/1
     module /atheos/sys/config/kernel.cfg
     module /atheos/sys/drivers/bus/pci
     module /atheos/sys/drivers/fs/afs
     module /atheos/sys/drivers/dev/disk/ata

This will tell GRUB to boot partition number 2 on the first drive
through the "root (hd0,1)" command and where to find the kernel, the
boot block-device driver and the boot-FS driver on that partition. The
"root=/dev/disk/ide/hda/1" string after the kernel-path is a parameter
that is passed to the kernel and tells what partition to mount as
/boot/ before continue to boot. The kernel can also take a number of
other parameters (listed below) that are given in the same manner after
the "root" param.

If you install Syllable on the second partition on the first drive the
default config-file is OK. otherwise you must edit the "root (disk,partition)
line to fit your setup. If you want to boot other OS's with GRUB you
must add them to the config file as well. For example to boot BeOS, or
Windows, or most other OS's that have a bootblock you can use the
"chainloader" command like this:

     title BeOS
     chainloader (hd0,3)+1

This will add a menu entry titled BeOS that will boot the OS
found on the fourth partition on the first disk.

You can also set a timeout for when to boot the first OS in the list
(or the default as set by the "default" command) with the "timeout"
command:

     timeout 5



		3.1. INSTALLING THE BOOTLOADER

When done editing the config file you must reboot the computer by
pressing <CTRL>, <ALT>, and <DEL> simultaneously (DO NOT HIT THE RESET
OR POWER BUTTON. THIS WILL CAUSE CACHED DATA THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN
WRITTEN TO THE DISK TO BE LOST AND THE INSTALLATION TO BE CORRUPTED!)
boot from the CD or first floppy disk again to install the bootloader.
This time you should abort GRUB before it boot Syllable by hitting <ESC>
and then hit "C" to enter the GRUB shell from which you can finish the
install.

Now you must decide whether you want to install GRUB in the MBR
(Master Boot Record) of the first drive and use it as a boot-manager
(or if Syllable is the only OS on the machine) or if you want to install
it on the AFS partition only and use another bootmanager select what
OS to boot.

In either case you must tell GRUB where to find the config file and
the second-stage loader by setting a "root" partition:

root (hd0,1)

If you did not install Syllable on the second partition on the first
disk you must change the parameters accordingly.

Then you must install the boot-loader with the "setup" command.

To install on a MBR of the first drive run:

setup (hd0)

To install it on the AFS partition only run:

setup (hd0,1) (again change the parameters according to your setup)

Now it should be possible to boot Syllable off the native partition.



		3.1.1. NOTES ON GRUB


GRUB understands the AFS filesystem and can boot any kernel located on
an AFS partition by changing the "kernel" line in the config file or
by manually loading the kernel and required modules from the GRUB
shell. There is no need to run any tools to update block-lists or
anything like that after installing new kernels.

Read the GRUB documentation <http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html>
and use the "help" command in the GRUB shell for more information on the
bootloader.



		4. FIRST BOOT


The first time you boot Syllable it will probe your computer to find drivers
for your hardware.  If a driver is found which supports some piece of hardware
the driver will be loaded automatically.

When all of the drivers are available Syllable will start the graphical user
interface.  You will see a single window in the centre of the screen with two
input fields and a "Login" button.

Before you will be able to do anything you will have to log in using a
user-name and a password. The base-installation comes with two predefined users.
"root"  with the password "root" is the super-user and has unrestricted access
to the system. The other user is "guest" with the password "guest". This is a
normal user. 

It is recommended that you log in as the "root" user this first time.  Enter the
username "root" and password "root" and click "Login" (Or press enter)  Syllable
will then load the Desktop and Launcher.

If something went wrong or Syllable failed to boot, please read section 3.2 of this
document ("SOLVING PROBLEMS").



		4.1. WHAT CAN I DO NOW?


You should read the Welcome text, which can be found in the following locations:

	On line at http://www.syllable.org/docs/latest/welcome.txt
	On the installation CD at Documentation/welcome.txt
	In Syllable at /atheos/Documentation/welcome.txt

The Welcome file contains information on Syllable websites, mailing lists,
software and hardware and will help you to get started with Syllable.



		4.2. SOLVING PROBLEMS
		

If Syllable has failed to install or you cannot boot Syllable there are various places
you can try for help and solutions to common problems.  Please read the Welcome file;
see section 3.1 of this file ("WHAT CAN I DO NOW?") for more information.

If there is a problem, the first thing you should do is try to narrow it down.  What
has gone wrong?  Did the CD fail to boot?  Was Syllable unable to find your hard drive?
Did the graphical user interface fail to start?  Collect any error messages that you see;
these will be useful in helping to solve your problem.  Make a note of your hardware
(Processor & motherboard type, total amount of memory, type of video card).

You should then check the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) at
http://www.syllable.org/modules.php?name=FAQ  These provide answers to very
common questions concerning Syllable.  There is also a community-maintained FAQ at
http://www.syllable-wiki.tk/ which may also answer your questions.

If you are sure it is a problem with Syllable check the Forums at
http://syllable.sourceforge.net/modules.php?name=Forums  Someone may already have
had the same problem as you and received a solution!

Finally, if none of those help, ask on the Syllable Developer mailing list.  You must
first subscribe to this list.  See
http://www.syllable.org/modules.php?name=Mailing_Lists for information on
how to subscribe.
