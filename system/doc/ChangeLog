Updated CodeView's Makefile to link against libsyllable.

* Nov 18 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Sound drivers now export their device nodes to different locations to allow
multiple devices to work at the same time.  DSP devices are created as
/dev/sound/<name>/dsp/<dsp #> and mixer devices are
/dev/sound/<name>/mixer/<mixer #>  Old applications which expect /dev/sound/dsp
& /dev/sound/mixer to be present will no longer work.

* Nov 16 2003, Kaj de Vos *

Fixed a number of build problems due to recent changes to Syllable:
- Added patch-config directives to a number of recipes for third-party
  packages to account for the new uname.
- Updated the build system to match.
- Added -lz flag to all decorator Makefiles to account for Zlib being
  shared now.

* Oct 6 2003, Kaj de Vos *

First check-in of the new build system.
Recipes for third-party software packages will follow,
and also tweaking to many native packages to make them comply.

Removed sed 4.0.7 because it didn't build after going through CVS.

Removed sh-utils and textutils. They were replaced by coreutils,
and sh-utils didn't build, anyway. I left fileutils in there
for reference to the patch it contains.

Removed freetype 2.1.3. It was replaced by freetype 2.1.4.

More Matrox driver changes.
	* Split off the DAC control code from the rest of the CRTC code
	* Support for older Matrox cards with Texas Instruments TVP3026 DACs
	* Bug fixes for the Millenium I
	* The driver does not export 15bit or very-high resolution video modes
	  for TVP3026 DACs

Hardware cursor code has been disabled and the driver has been "hardwired" to
never use Vesa mode-switching, which means it can detect but not work with newer
Matrox cards (E.g. the Gx50 & Parhalea cards)

* Jul 14 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Fixes to the nVidia, Mach64 & SiS3xx video drivers from Arno Klenke <arno_klenke@yahoo.de>
From Arno "There was a bug in the videooverlay code of all these drivers which caused screen
corruptions while the overlay was active. I have also added the newest XFree driver code to
the sis driver and vesa mode switching for notebook chipsets to the mach driver."

* Jul 5 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Imported tar 1.13.25 and coreutils 5.0.

delete the newline character on the line above, but instead the first character of the
line above.)

* May 17 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

The BIOS and ATA drivers now check for kernel parameters that indicate which drives and
controllers to enable.  For the BIOS driver:

o By default, the driver only probes for floppy drives and ignores all harddrives
o Individual drives can be enabled by passing hd?=bios in the kernel parameters E.g.
   hda=bios enables the BIOS driver for hda
 
For the ATA driver:

o By default the driver probes for a Primary and a Secondary controller but no others.
o The primary controller can be disabled by passing ata0=disabled in the kernel paramters.
  The secondary controller can be disabled by passing ata1=disabled.

The BIOS & ATA paramters can be combined.  E.g. if you wish to disable the ATA controller
for hda and hdb and instead use the BIOS driver, while leaving the drive cdc enabled in
the ATA driver you would pass:

ata0=disabled hda=bios hdb=bios

* May 11 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

Checked in CodeView class.
