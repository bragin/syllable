 Applied Arno's patches:
 - The UploadVideoData() method has been removed from the DisplayDriver
   class. There will probably a more general solution for this in the future.
 - The window buttons have changed: Clicking on the zoom button will
   maximize the window and clicking on the toggle button will minimize the
   window.

  Updated freetype.makefile to Freetype 2.1.5. I didn't import the sources,
  because they're supposed to be installed by the new build system now.

  Added a -lz flag to all decorator Makefiles to make them build with the
  shared Zlib library.

* September 19 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 LibSyllable
 - Added TreeView class
 - Added DateTime class
 - Patched ListView to support the TreeView class
 - Added documentation to ListView
 - Added multiplication operator to Point (useful for scaling)
 - Patched layout classes, "wheight" changed to "weight".

* August 25 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

  Filerequester
  - Moved private members to internal class

  Checkmenu.h
  - Name change: Highlight() -> SetHighlighted()

  Desktop
  - New method: Activate(), switches display to a certain desktop

  Application
  - New method: SwitchDesktop(), used by Desktop::Activate()
  
  Image
  - Bug in GetBounds() fixed.
  
  Appserver
  - Font directory watch patch applied (fonts are scanned automatically when a new font is added to
    the font directory (Rick).

* August 24 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

  Name change: libatheos is now named libsyllable.

* August 23 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

  Filerequester.cpp
  - Applied Rick's patch, adds icons to the filerequester.

  Splitter.cpp/splitter.h:
  - Spelling mistake fixed

  Menu.cpp/menu.h:
  - Applied Rick's disable-patch.
  - Added greying to disabled items (so you see that they are disabled).
  - Moved private members to separate class.
  - Added methods to acces those members and updated Menu to use those methods
    instead of accessing private members directly. Apart from improving
    encapsulation, this also means that subclasses of MenuItem can generate
    menus dynamically.
  - Fixed the three RemoveItem mehtods.
  - Added IsHighlighted(), renamed Highlight() to SetHighlighted().  This
    method is hardly used outside the Menu class, so the renaming will not
    have any impact on source compatibility.
  - Removed 2 pixels from the height of horizontal menu bars. (looks better)

* May 24 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

Changed view.cpp so it adheres flags of the default font (anti-AA).

Patched listview.cpp and added calls to ListViewRow::SetRect() in
InsertRow() so that rows  will know the available width. (Useful when
adding controls to listview rows.)

* Aug 25 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Patched both the FileRequester & Alert dialogs
(filerequester.cpp & requester.cpp) by Rick Caudill < cau0730@cup.edu >
which improve the functionality of the standard Load / Save dialogs, and
add the ability to display an icon on an Alert.

Updated screenshot support with a patch from Iain Hutchison
