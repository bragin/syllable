   pzLabel parameters from char* to String&, in the following classes:

* January 12 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

 AppServer:
 * Ran sindent.sh on the .cpp files.

* January 9 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

 API:
 * Changed all std::string to os::String, and, where applicable, pzName and
  pzLabel parameters from char* to String&, in the following classes:
    Font, View, Control, Button, CheckBox, CheckMenu, Window, VideoOverlay,
    Image, ScrollBar, Image, StringView, ImageView, ImageButton, Spinner,
    Slider, Splitter, ProgressBar, TreeView, TabView, TableView,
    LayoutView, RadioButton, ListView, TextView, DropdownMenu, Menu,
    DirectoryView, FileRequester, Alert/ProgressRequester, FrameView,
    Message, Looper, Handler, Application, Settings

  DirectoryView and FileRequester still contains some std::strings, but none
  are left in the interface.

	View, Control, Button, CheckBox, FileRequester, RadioButton,
	DropdownMenu, Spinner

 * Moved private variables to a Private class, or added a pointer for future
  use in classes that didn't have private variables, in the following
  classes:

 * Added/changed focus indicator in the following classes:
  (this also includes changing the Activated() method to invalidate the
  widget.)
	Button, CheckBox, RadioButton, DropdownMenu, Spinner

  multi-line capabilities and is the first step towards support for
  vertical layout languages.

* January 2 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

 API:
 - Added Rick's PopupMenu class
 - ShortcutKey changed to use a unicode wide char instead of UTF-8
 - Window::AddShortcut now checks that the supplied ShortcutKey is valid.

* December 30 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 API:
 - Splitter class:
    * Fixed a bug that caused the splitter to follow the mouse pointer
      even if it had not been clicked on first.
 - Rect class:
    * Added Scale() method, needed by the (crude) vector graphics in the
      amiga decorator.

 AppServer:
 - Made some changes to the decorator API:
    * SetButtonState() replaces the SetXXXButtonState() methods.
    * Added HIT_MINIMIZE and HIT_STICKY.
    * Added a note in the windowdecorator.h file, saying that the sequence
      of the enum hit_items should not be changed, so that decorators can
      store button state information in arrays.
 - Added code for handling of the new MINIMIZE button, and cleaned up
   the button handling a bit.
 - Added a MINIMIZE button to the default decorator.
 - The default decorator now uses arrays to store information about the
   border buttons (makes the code easier to follow).
 - The default decorator does no longer draw partial buttons in buttonless
   windows.

 Decorators:
 - Updated the amiga decorator with code from the default decorator.
   (minimize button + better handling of buttons).
 - Updated the other decorators to work with the new API, did NOT add a
   minimize button to any of them at this time.
 - All decorators are now linked against libsyllable.

* December 5 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 - Window class:
    * Added AddShortcut() and RemoveShortcut().
    * Added code to handle shortcuts.
 - New class: util/shortcutkey.cpp
 - Checked in parts of Arno's patch that I missed last time...

* December 1 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 Applied Arno's patches:
 - The window buttons have changed: Clicking on the zoom button will
   maximize the window and clicking on the toggle button will minimize the
   window.
 - Caching of the converted font palette.
 - The appserver can close all opened windows on the screen if it receives
   the DR_CLOSE_WINDOWS message. This still needs some more testing with
   applications until we use this call.
 - Window class:
    * Added a SetIcon() and GetIcon() method.
    * Implemented ScreenModeChanged() and DesktopActivated().
    * Added a WindowsChanged() method that is called if the windows on
      the desktop change. (e.g. new ones appear, their icons or titles change)
 - Desktop class:
    * Moved the private class members into a private class.
    * Added a GetWindows() and ActivateWindow() method.

 - Video driver API:

	* The drivers have been splitted into a kernel and an appserver driver.
	  The kernel drivers are really generic for now. They scan for supported
	  cards and create device nodes for them in /dev/graphics. The kernel
	  drivers have to implement the IOCTL_GET_APPSERVER_DRIVER ioctl, that is
	  used by the appserver to find out what appserver driver belongs to the
	  kernel driver. Although the implementation of other ioctls is private to
	  the appserver and kernel driver, I have predefined some for pci graphics
	  cards in a header file called "pci_graphics.h" in /ainc/appserver.
	* The appserver iterates through the /dev/graphics directory. For now it
	  only uses the first node it finds. Then it opens the device, gets the
	  name of the appserver driver, loads the appserver driver and calls the
	  init_gfx_driver() function of it with the filedescriptor of the opened
	  device node.
	* The RenderGlyph() methods have been moved into the DisplayDriver class
	  to avoid accesses to the framebuffer from outside this class.

* November 30 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 message.h + message.cpp
 - REPLY_SENDT -> REPLY_SENT

 looper.h + looper.cpp

 Thread
 - Stack size can now be set when a thread is created.

 Menu
 - Menu::GetPreferredSize() now returns correct maximum value.

 Splitter

 - now refers to how the children are displayed, not how the splitter
 - separator is rendered.
 - The Splitter now resizes its children when it is resized.
 - The Splitter separator is now drawn correctly.
 - Fixed misspelled variable nFalgs -> nFlags.
 - Splitter will now respect Views' minimum sizes as returned by GetPreferredSize(false).
 - Relative sizes of Views are now retained when resizing.

* November 16 2003, Kaj de Vos *

  Updated freetype.makefile to Freetype 2.1.5. I didn't import the sources,
  because they're supposed to be installed by the new build system now.

  Added a -lz flag to all decorator Makefiles to make them build with the
  shared Zlib library.

* September 19 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 LibSyllable

  Filerequester.cpp
  - Applied Rick's patch, adds icons to the filerequester.

  Splitter.cpp/splitter.h:
  - Spelling mistake fixed

  Menu.cpp/menu.h:
  - Applied Rick's disable-patch.
  - Added greying to disabled items (so you see that they are disabled).
  - Moved private members to separate class.
  - Added methods to acces those members and updated Menu to use those methods
    instead of accessing private members directly. Apart from improving
    encapsulation, this also means that subclasses of MenuItem can generate
    menus dynamically.
  - Fixed the three RemoveItem mehtods.
  - Added IsHighlighted(), renamed Highlight() to SetHighlighted().  This
    method is hardly used outside the Menu class, so the renaming will not
    have any impact on source compatibility.
  - Removed 2 pixels from the height of horizontal menu bars. (looks better)
