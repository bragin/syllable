  Filerequester.cpp
  - Applied Rick's patch, adds icons to the filerequester.

  Splitter.cpp/splitter.h:
  - Spelling mistake fixed

  Menu.cpp/menu.h:
  - Applied Rick's disable-patch.
  - Added greying to disabled items (so you see that they are disabled).
  - Moved private members to separate class.
  - Added methods to acces those members and updated Menu to use those methods
    instead of accessing private members directly. Apart from improving
    encapsulation, this also means that subclasses of MenuItem can generate
    menus dynamically.
  - Fixed the three RemoveItem mehtods.
  - Added IsHighlighted(), renamed Highlight() to SetHighlighted().  This
    method is hardly used outside the Menu class, so the renaming will not
    have any impact on source compatibility.
  - Removed 2 pixels from the height of horizontal menu bars. (looks better)

Changed view.cpp so it adheres flags of the default font (anti-AA).

Changed amiga decorator to use thin borders and changed the aspect ratio of
border buttons to better match the look of the Amiga GUI.

Patched os::Message to be a friend class of Settings.
Patched Color32_s and added a new constructor that takes an uint32
(needed by os::BitmapImage).

* Sept 15 2002, Henrik Isaksson *

Patched listview.cpp and added calls to ListViewRow::SetRect() in
InsertRow() so that rows  will know the available width. (Useful when
adding controls to listview rows.)

* Aug 25 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Patched both the FileRequester & Alert dialogs
(filerequester.cpp & requester.cpp) by Rick Caudill < cau0730@cup.edu >
which improve the functionality of the standard Load / Save dialogs, and
add the ability to display an icon on an Alert.

* Aug 25 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Updated screenshot support with a patch from Iain Hutchison
< iain_hutchison@yahoo.com >  The patch means that the appserver now has

canceled) from the focus stack, which stops hidden windows from being given
focus.

* Aug 10th 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

The CheckMark for CheckMenus has been moved to the left of the label.
In order for all Menu labels to align, menu labels are now offset to the right,

Added the CheckMenu class.

* Aug 3rd 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *
