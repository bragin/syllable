* January 27 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

 * Fixed stupid mistake in NodeMonitor; m was being deleted too soon.
 * Fixed crash in DirectoryView when changing dirs.

   returning actual content size, not minimum size). This caused Whisper
   to resize the mail view larger than the window sometimes.

* January 25 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

 * Changed all std::string to os::String, and, where applicable, pzName and
   pzLabel parameters from char* to String&, in the following classes:

* January 12 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

 AppServer:
 * Ran sindent.sh on the .cpp files.

* January 9 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

 API:
 * Changed all std::string to os::String, and, where applicable, pzName and
  pzLabel parameters from char* to String&, in the following classes:
    Font, View, Control, Button, CheckBox, CheckMenu, Window, VideoOverlay,
    Image, ScrollBar, Image, StringView, ImageView, ImageButton, Spinner,
    Slider, Splitter, ProgressBar, TreeView, TabView, TableView,
    LayoutView, RadioButton, ListView, TextView, DropdownMenu, Menu,
    DirectoryView, FileRequester, Alert/ProgressRequester, FrameView,
    Message, Looper, Handler, Application, Settings

  DirectoryView and FileRequester still contains some std::strings, but none
  are left in the interface.

 * Added shortcut support to the following classes:
	View, Control, Button, CheckBox, FileRequester, RadioButton,
	DropdownMenu, Spinner

 * Moved private variables to a Private class, or added a pointer for future
  use in classes that didn't have private variables, in the following
  classes:
	CheckBox, RadioButton, Spinner, Slider

 * Added/changed focus indicator in the following classes:
  (this also includes changing the Activated() method to invalidate the
  widget.)
	Button, CheckBox, RadioButton, DropdownMenu, Spinner

 * Changed the following classes to use DrawText() and GetTextExtent(), adds
  multi-line capabilities and is the first step towards support for
  vertical layout languages.
	Button, StringView, CheckBox, RadioButton

 * Changed GetPreferredSize to return the correct maximum size in the
  following classes:
	Button, CheckBox

  Note! This may distort the layout in some apps.

 * Other changes/details:

		o Added SetShortcutFromLabel()
		o Added DrawText()
		o Added GetTextExtent()
	- Control
		o Removed obsolete method ValueChanged
	- FileRequester
		o Added shortcuts to buttons (Load, Save, Cancel)
	- ListView
		o Applied patch from Rick, makes it possible to add context
		  menus.
	- Font
		o Added GetTextEntent()

* January 5 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

 AppServer:
 - Added DRC_DRAW_TEXT and AR_GET_TEXT_EXTENTS to protocol.h
 - Added DrawText flags to guidefines.h
 - layer.h+render.cpp, added DrawText method.
 - sapplication.cpp, added AR_GET_TEXT_EXTENTS
 - sfont.h+sfont.cpp, added GetTextExtent
 - swindow.cpp, added DRC_DRAW_TEXT

* January 2 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

 API:
 - Added Rick's PopupMenu class
 - ShortcutKey changed to use a unicode wide char instead of UTF-8
 - Window::AddShortcut now checks that the supplied ShortcutKey is valid.

* December 30 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 API:
 - Splitter class:
    * Fixed a bug that caused the splitter to follow the mouse pointer
      even if it had not been clicked on first.
 - Rect class:
    * Added Scale() method, needed by the (crude) vector graphics in the
      amiga decorator.

 AppServer:
 - Made some changes to the decorator API:
    * SetButtonState() replaces the SetXXXButtonState() methods.
    * Added HIT_MINIMIZE and HIT_STICKY.
    * Added a note in the windowdecorator.h file, saying that the sequence
      of the enum hit_items should not be changed, so that decorators can
      store button state information in arrays.
 - Added code for handling of the new MINIMIZE button, and cleaned up
   the button handling a bit.
 - Added a MINIMIZE button to the default decorator.
 - The default decorator now uses arrays to store information about the
   border buttons (makes the code easier to follow).
 - The default decorator does no longer draw partial buttons in buttonless
   windows.

 Decorators:
 - Updated the amiga decorator with code from the default decorator.
   (minimize button + better handling of buttons).
 - Updated the other decorators to work with the new API, did NOT add a
   minimize button to any of them at this time.
 - All decorators are now linked against libsyllable.

* December 5 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 - Window class:
    * Added AddShortcut() and RemoveShortcut().
    * Added code to handle shortcuts.
 - New class: util/shortcutkey.cpp
 - Checked in parts of Arno's patch that I missed last time...

* December 1 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 Applied Arno's patches:
 - The window buttons have changed: Clicking on the zoom button will
   maximize the window and clicking on the toggle button will minimize the
   window.
 - Caching of the converted font palette.
 - The appserver can close all opened windows on the screen if it receives
   the DR_CLOSE_WINDOWS message. This still needs some more testing with
   applications until we use this call.
 - Window class:
    * Added a SetIcon() and GetIcon() method.
    * Implemented ScreenModeChanged() and DesktopActivated().
    * Added a WindowsChanged() method that is called if the windows on
      the desktop change. (e.g. new ones appear, their icons or titles change)
 - Desktop class:
    * Moved the private class members into a private class.
    * Added a GetWindows() and ActivateWindow() method.

 - Video driver API:

	* The drivers have been splitted into a kernel and an appserver driver.
	  The kernel drivers are really generic for now. They scan for supported
	  cards and create device nodes for them in /dev/graphics. The kernel
	  drivers have to implement the IOCTL_GET_APPSERVER_DRIVER ioctl, that is
	  used by the appserver to find out what appserver driver belongs to the
	  kernel driver. Although the implementation of other ioctls is private to
	  the appserver and kernel driver, I have predefined some for pci graphics
	  cards in a header file called "pci_graphics.h" in /ainc/appserver.
	* The appserver iterates through the /dev/graphics directory. For now it
	  only uses the first node it finds. Then it opens the device, gets the
	  name of the appserver driver, loads the appserver driver and calls the
	  init_gfx_driver() function of it with the filedescriptor of the opened
	  device node.
	* The RenderGlyph() methods have been moved into the DisplayDriver class
	  to avoid accesses to the framebuffer from outside this class.

* November 30 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 message.h + message.cpp
 - REPLY_SENDT -> REPLY_SENT

* November 16 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 Thread
 - Stack size can now be set when a thread is created.

 Menu
 - Menu::GetPreferredSize() now returns correct maximum value.

 Splitter
 - Changed the meaning of VERTICAL and HORIZONTAL orientation. Orientation
 - now refers to how the children are displayed, not how the splitter
 - separator is rendered.
 - The Splitter now resizes its children when it is resized.
 - The Splitter separator is now drawn correctly.
 - Fixed misspelled variable nFalgs -> nFlags.
 - Splitter will now respect Views' minimum sizes as returned by GetPreferredSize(false).
 - Relative sizes of Views are now retained when resizing.

* November 16 2003, Kaj de Vos *

  Updated freetype.makefile to Freetype 2.1.5. I didn't import the sources,
  because they're supposed to be installed by the new build system now.

  Added a -lz flag to all decorator Makefiles to make them build with the
  shared Zlib library.

* September 19 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

 LibSyllable
 - Added TreeView class
 - Added DateTime class
 - Patched ListView to support the TreeView class
 - Added documentation to ListView
 - Added multiplication operator to Point (useful for scaling)
 - Patched layout classes, "wheight" changed to "weight".

* August 25 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

  Filerequester
  - Moved private members to internal class

  Checkmenu.h
  - Name change: Highlight() -> SetHighlighted()

  Desktop
  - New method: Activate(), switches display to a certain desktop

  Application
  - New method: SwitchDesktop(), used by Desktop::Activate()
  
  Image
  - Bug in GetBounds() fixed.
  
  Appserver
  - Font directory watch patch applied (fonts are scanned automatically when a new font is added to
    the font directory (Rick).
  - Alt-Tab Window selector now respects colour preferences (Rick).
  - SwitchDesktop capability (Rick).
  
* August 24 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

  Name change: libatheos is now named libsyllable.

* August 23 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

  Filerequester.cpp
  - Applied Rick's patch, adds icons to the filerequester.

  Splitter.cpp/splitter.h:
  - Spelling mistake fixed

  Menu.cpp/menu.h:
  - Applied Rick's disable-patch.
  - Added greying to disabled items (so you see that they are disabled).
  - Moved private members to separate class.
  - Added methods to acces those members and updated Menu to use those methods
    instead of accessing private members directly. Apart from improving
    encapsulation, this also means that subclasses of MenuItem can generate
    menus dynamically.
  - Fixed the three RemoveItem mehtods.
  - Added IsHighlighted(), renamed Highlight() to SetHighlighted().  This
    method is hardly used outside the Menu class, so the renaming will not
    have any impact on source compatibility.
  - Removed 2 pixels from the height of horizontal menu bars. (looks better)

* July 16 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

freetype includes. Updating freetype should now only be a matter of
editing /appserver/server/freetype.makefile.

* May 24 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

Changed view.cpp so it adheres flags of the default font (anti-AA).

Added flags field to SET/GET_DEFAULT_FONTS message (passed to the appserver
to access default fonts). Adding the flags field makes it possible to for
a prefs programme to enable/disable anti-aliasing.

accident...)

Fixed a bug in keyboard.cpp (appserver) concerning dead keys with qualifiers.

* May 17 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

Added CenterInWindow() to Window (window.cpp and window.h)
Patched TextView (textview.cpp), adds keyboard shortcuts for copy: CTRL+C,
paste: CTRL+V, cut: CTRL+X, undo: CTRL+Z, redo: CTRL+Y
Fixed crash bug and compile warning in TextView::GetValue()
Changed vertical centering in Button so it hopefully looks better with ft 2.1.3
Patched vertical centering in the following decorators for ft 2.1.3: amiga,
beish, drow, mulvane, next, photon, red, win98
Changed amiga decorator to use thin borders and changed the aspect ratio of
border buttons to better match the look of the Amiga GUI.

* Dec 4 2002, Henrik Isaksson *

settings.cpp).
Added header files for the classes above.
Patched pngtrans.cpp for save support.
Patched os::Message to be a friend class of Settings.
Patched Color32_s and added a new constructor that takes an uint32
(needed by os::BitmapImage).

* Sept 15 2002, Henrik Isaksson *

Patched listview.cpp and added calls to ListViewRow::SetRect() in
InsertRow() so that rows  will know the available width. (Useful when
adding controls to listview rows.)

* Aug 25 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Patched both the FileRequester & Alert dialogs
(filerequester.cpp & requester.cpp) by Rick Caudill < cau0730@cup.edu >
which improve the functionality of the standard Load / Save dialogs, and
add the ability to display an icon on an Alert.

* Aug 25 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Updated screenshot support with a patch from Iain Hutchison
< iain_hutchison@yahoo.com >  The patch means that the appserver now has
support for screenshots in all true-colour bit-depths (15, 16, 24, 32 bit).

* Aug 25 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added a Splitter class, written by Sebastien Keim < s.keim@laposte.net >  See
the GUI documentation for more information.

* Aug 11 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Applied a patch to the appserver, from Henrik Isaksson (henrik@boing.nu)
The patch removes "hidden" windows (E.g. a File Requester which has been
canceled) from the focus stack, which stops hidden windows from being given
focus.

* Aug 10th 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

The CheckMark for CheckMenus has been moved to the left of the label.
In order for all Menu labels to align, menu labels are now offset to the right,
which leaves a space to the left of the menu.

* Aug 4th 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added the CheckMenu class.

* Aug 3rd 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Aplied a series of patches from Henrik Isaksson, which adds a "Grayed out" look to
disabled controls.  The following files have been patched:

	sys/appserver/libatheos/gui/checkbox.cpp
	sys/appserver/libatheos/gui/dropdownmenu.cpp
	sys/appserver/libatheos/gui/radiobutton.cpp

	sys/appserver/libatheos/gui/textview.cpp

	sys/include/gui/scrollbar.h

* Aug 3rd 2002, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

	The sub-menu arrow is now drawn corretly, and menus which have children
	are now drawn slightly larger to allow for the arrow.
