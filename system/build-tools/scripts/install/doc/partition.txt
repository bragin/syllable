Before you can install Syllable you must first create and then format a 
partition on your harddrive.  If you have already created a partition for
Syllable then you may skip that step but you must still format it.

WARNING: Partitioning a drive which already contains data may destroy
the contents of that drive!  Ensure that you have backed up any data that
you wish to keep before you proceed to partition and format your hard drive.
