You must now configure the Grub boot-menu file.  Please read the
following information before you attempt to do this, as errors in the
configuration file will mean that you will not be able to boot Syllable.

First you must tell GRUB where to find the kernel and the required
disk/FS drivers to load before booting Syllable. This information is
found in "/afs/boot/grub/menu.lst". If you have other OS's installed
on the machine you must either configure GRUB as a boot-manager or
install another boot-manager that can "chainload" GRUB from the AFS
partition.

The menu.lst file should look something like this to boot Syllable from
the installation described above:

     title  Syllable
     root   (hd0,1)
     kernel /atheos/sys/kernel.so root=/dev/disk/ide/hda/1
     module /atheos/sys/config/kernel.cfg
     module /atheos/sys/drivers/bus/pci
     module /atheos/sys/drivers/fs/afs
     module /atheos/sys/drivers/dev/disk/ata
