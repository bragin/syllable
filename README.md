# Syllable Operating System

This repository is moved here as a conversion from official Syllable's SourceForge.net CVS repo in a hope that development would continue and to preserve history and make huge amount of work done for many years.

## Documentation
Now I am filling the [Wiki](https://github.com/syllable-org/syllable/wiki) with various useful information like SUB (Syllable's User Bible, which is nearly extinct from the Internet Archives). It's a great source of information and you're welcome to fill it in too.

## What is Syllable

Syllable was born in July 2002 as a fork of the AtheOS operating system. Several AtheOS developers, concerned about the long-term development of AtheOS, created Syllable to ensure that development would continue.

The goal of Syllable is to create a reliable and easy-to-use open source operating system for the home and small office user. We also want to encourage developers to create an operating system that is intuitive, easy to use, and powerful.

Syllable is still being developed, but it is already stable and relatively mature, including the following features:

* Booting usually takes less than ten seconds
* A full GUI is built into the OS
* Support for a wide range of common hardware devices, including video, network, and sound cards from manufacturers such as Intel, AMD, 3Com, nVidia, and Creative (see Syllable Hardware for a complete list)
* Internet access through an Ethernet network (though PPP and PPPoE are not yet supported)
* A graphical web browser (ABrowse) and e-mail client (Whisper), and hundreds of other native applications (see Kamidake for a complete list)
* A journalled file system, modelled on the BeOS file system
* An application launcher (like the Windows Start button)
* 99% POSIX compliance
* GUI-based preferences tools for networking, display preferences, user administration, etc.
* The entire source is available via the GPL
* An object-oriented programming API
